"""The job lease and its heartbeat (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §4.4; security review §4.1).

The run's first transaction takes the lease (`owner` = `CLOUD_RUN_EXECUTION/CLOUD_RUN_TASK_ATTEMPT`, `until` = now +
`LEASE_SECONDS`) when it is absent, lapsed or its own, and sets `running` and `startedAt`; a lease another live owner
holds makes the run exit 0 without touching the job (`S-P01-BAD-DUPLICATE-EXECUTION`). Every `HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
the heartbeat extends the lease while it is still the owner, writes the step and the progress, and reads
`cancelRequested`; a lease someone else took is raised as `LeaseLostError` at the next checkpoint.
