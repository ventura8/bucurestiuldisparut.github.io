"""The archive's shared vocabulary (twins of `packages/shared/src/schemas/imagery-archive.ts`, held equal by `enums.json`) and records.

`FileRow` is one file of the archive as the probe read it; it stays in the worker's own `archive.json`. `Series` is what the report
proposes for a group of files. Paths are always relative to the archive's root, POSIX-style.
