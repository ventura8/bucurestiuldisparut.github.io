"""An archive series' sheets copied from the computer that holds the archive to the worker that runs the job (M20 §4.1).

Live report of 2026-11-13: the owner's three computers all run archive series, yet the scanned maps were imported on one. The
computer that holds the archive whole sends one series' sheets on request (`send_copy`): each sheet once, named by its SHA-256, and
a `manifest.json` with the series' part of the scan's record, to `tmp/archive-copies/{city}/{job}/` (the bucket deletes it after a
day), through the signed URLs of `worker.archiveCopy`, then says `done` with the bytes sent. The worker that runs the job and has
not the sheets (`ensure_series`) reads the manifest through `worker.urls`, downloads the sheets, checks every SHA-256 and keeps them
in its own archive store (`ArchiveStore.merge_copy`, never named as held whole); with no copy yet it raises
`ArchiveElsewhereError`, and the worker hands the job back without spending an attempt.
