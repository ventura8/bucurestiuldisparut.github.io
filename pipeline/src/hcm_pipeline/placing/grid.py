"""Class b: a sheet series placed from its sheets' names on the city grid (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §3 b).

1. Parse: each sheet's name is a cell of its grammar (`archive.grammar`); the grammar's grid scheme (`gridscheme`) says where the cell
   lies in the grid's metres. A grammar with no scheme yet, or a name the report marked odd, is not placed by name.
2. Frame per sheet: the neat line on a reduced copy (`frame`); its four corners make the sheet's homography to its cell. A sheet with
   no printed neat line (the cadastral sheets) is framed by its drawing's extent when that holds its cell's shape (M22 §4.1). A sheet
   framed by neither is left out and counted (`frame-not-found`): one bad sheet never blocks the series.
3. The quarter numbering: of the eight orders, the one whose neighbouring sheets continue each other's lines best (edge profiles).
4. Solve the grid once: the sheets pasted on the grid at 2 m (coarser for a city-wide series) make the whole series' street
   pattern, placed on the reference (the ladder, then OpenStreetMap) as a map of known scale, north up, its fit rigid (an affine),
   with the rival search and the held-out checks of a drawn map (`single`). A grid the owner confirmed (`params.gridId`,
   `cities/{c}/grids/{g}`) starts the fit instead of the search. Batch 4 (§5.1): a grid that does not prove but was fitted is still
   rendered from the sheets' names (`grid-names`), with its seams and its checks against the reference measured, for the owner alone to
   approve by hand (the policy never publishes it); with no fit at all it waits for a person, its mosaic kept as the one stitched
   picture the Help calibrate wizard places (`stitched`, M22 §4.1).
5. Render: each sheet warped from its own scan into the series' one `warped.tif`, cut at its neat line (hard seams, no feather), through
   a 5 x 5 lattice of its homography composed with the solved grid.

The joint seam solve across neighbours (paper shrink, scanner skew), the TPS where 30 printed crossings support it and the crossing
detection on a printed grid (the IGA quadrants) are not built: the frames' homographies and one rigid grid stand for them.
