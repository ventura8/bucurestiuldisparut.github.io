"""The stitched picture a waiting series leaves (docs/research/M22-help-calibrate.md §4.1): the admin works on one picture, never on
thousands of sheets.

Whatever a grid, an atlas or a pieces series could not prove on its own, its sheets were already joined into one canvas (the grid's
mosaic from its names and frames, the atlas's pages by their edges or their overlaps, the pieces by their overlaps). That canvas is
kept beside the job's files (`stitched.tif`: it stays where the job runs, as `warped.tif` does) and a preview of it (`stitched.jpg`, its
long side at most `PREVIEW_PX`, the georeferencer's own preview size) goes up with the version, which the Help calibrate wizard lays
over the map. The georeferencer gets it too, as it gets a frame's: the picture as the version's `scan` (`scan.tif`, at most
`SCAN_MAX_PX` long, and `scan-preview.jpg`) and the city window's OpenStreetMap lines as its `reference` (`reference-osm.png`), so an
archive series waiting for points opens there like any frame (never Mapbox Satellite). The version's `help.stitched` says what it
holds: its size, how many parts joined, which were left out and why, and the joins' quality (the matched overlaps' inliers and
their residual, in canvas pixels).
