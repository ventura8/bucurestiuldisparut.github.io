"""A waiting series placed from the owner's pairs (docs/research/M22-help-calibrate.md §4.1, docs/LESSONS.md, 2026-11-10).

A series that parked (`needs_gcps`) left its stitched picture as the version's `scan` (`placing/stitched.py`: at most `SCAN_MAX_PX`
long), and the owner placed pairs on it in the georeferencer; `imagery.saveGcps` wrote them as the version's `georef` (`method: 'gcps'`)
and queued `place` again. `place` then fits those pairs with their transform (`georef/transforms.py`, as `steps/georef.py` fits a
frame's) and never runs the class's placer again, which only re-parked the series. The pairs are scaled from the scan's pixels to the
kept `stitched.tif` (the job's work folder; the scan itself when that is gone), sampled into a lattice through the fit as `steps/warp.py`
does for a polynomial (a thin-plate spline through its own enabled pairs), and warped into `warped.tif` at the series' `maxzoom`;
the version's `georef` gets the fit's figures and `archive` its report (`method: 'gcps'`). Too few pairs, or pairs in a line, park the
series again with its help as it was and the owner's pairs kept, so the georeferencer opens with them.
