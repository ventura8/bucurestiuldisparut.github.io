"""Coarse placement of a drawn map on its reference (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §3 c step 4): chamfer over similarities.

The map's street skeleton (points in its working pixels) is drawn, for each scale and rotation tried, as a template in the reference's
pixels; correlating it with the reference's closeness image (OpenCV's template matching, by FFT) scores every shift at once, as the mean
closeness of the map's lines to the reference's less what the same area of the reference would give anywhere (zero-mean correlation:
lesson 511). A plain mean favours wherever the reference is densest, and a dense town wins over the true place. The scale comes from
the map's printed scale when it is known (a narrow band around it), else from a wide band of sizes against the city; the rotation is
north up, give or take a few degrees, in each of the four quarter turns.
The best placements are kept, each more than `RIVAL_SHARE` of the map's size from the others (M9's rival search): `CANDIDATES` of
them. A street grid scores almost as well one block over, so the chamfer score alone can neither choose nor refuse: the fine fit runs on
each, the one whose junctions agree with the most pairs wins, and it holds only when the runner-up agrees with far fewer (`single`).
