"""A placed series laid on its overview again, the owner's pairs kept (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §15, DECISIONS-for-review.md §205).

`imagery.locateAgain` on a published (or waiting) archive series that was placed from the owner's pairs on its overview mosaic, with
pieces left out of that mosaic, starts a new version of the same layer whose job asks `restitch` (`functions/src/imagery/restitch.ts`).
Its `place` lays the series on the overview again (the second pass in the holes included: `overview_holes`), keeps the new mosaic as
the job's `stitched.tif` and publishes it as the version's stitched picture and scan, then warps it through the base's pairs
(`owner.place_from_pairs`). The pairs still hold: an overview mosaic's frame is the overview's own, resized, so a pixel of the base's
scan and the same pixel of the new one name the same overview pixel (`owner.picture_of` scales the pairs by the two sizes). When the
overview places the series no more (its file gone from this computer, too few pieces matching), the series waits for points again on
the base's picture.
