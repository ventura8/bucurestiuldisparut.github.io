"""The sheets of an atlas or pieces as small working copies (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §19.2): bounded, one sheet read at a time.

Each sheet is read reduced (`work_px`: its long side, smaller for a long series so all copies stay within `WORK_BUDGET_BYTES`), in
grey, cropped to its content (`frame.content_box`: inside its frame, or its paper margins trimmed) and told blank or not. Its turn and
flip are one of eight `variants` (a turn clockwise of 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees, then a mirror left to right). Every copy is brought
to the series' one cell (`cell_of`, the median sheet's shape): the sheets' scale differences (a page scanned at another resolution,
paper shrink) are taken out before the seams compare them.
