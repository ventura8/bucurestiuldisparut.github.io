"""An automatic layout mosaicked and placed, or kept for its owner (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §19.6, §19.7).

`mosaicked` writes the canvas window by window (`canvas_window`) and places it as one map; when that map waits for points, its picture
is kept as the stitched one with the layout's files. `wait_layout` does not mosaic: it renders a preview of the proposal (at most
`SCAN_MAX_PX`, the georeferencer's scan) and the version waits with `layout-check` for its owner to check the layout in the tile wizard.
