"""A second pass for the pieces the overview's features left out: each is looked for only in the overview's holes
(docs/research/M20-import-local.md, *Atlases and pieces*, the second pass).

The first pass (`overview.fit_tiles`) matches every piece against the whole overview's features, so a piece whose streets look like
many others' (a quiet edge of town, a park, a railway yard) loses the ratio test to its look-alikes and is left out (harti.zip 1895: 3 of
60). Once the other pieces are placed, two things are known: the series' scale and turn (the strong fits' consensus) and where the
overview is still uncovered. A left-out piece is then turned and scaled by the consensus and searched by normalised cross-correlation
only where it would cover a hole; the best place is kept only when it is clearly better than every other one and the piece is not blank,
and it is refined by the piece's features within that window when they agree. Nothing is drawn or invented: the piece's own pixels
are pasted where the overview, the same printed map, shows them to belong; a piece that is not found stays out.
