"""An atlas's or pieces' grid read from their file and folder names (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §19.1).

The schemes, tried on each name's stem, the first one most names agree on wins:

- `r1c2` (row 1, column 2), `3_7` or `03-07` (row, column), `C12` (a letter row and a number column), all counted from 1;
- a sheet number with a quadrant letter `A` to `D` (`12A`, `12-b`): sheet 12's top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right quarter,
  on a grid twice as fine;
- folders as rows (`row1/…`, `row2/…`), each folder's files in natural order its columns;
- else the natural order (`img003`, a PDF's page numbers): each name's index, its columns not known (`col_candidates`).

The order is the fallback the seams check (`autostitch`): a numbered atlas whose page count factors several ways gets its columns from the
seams that join best. `cell_of` is the one parser of a single name against a known grid (the overview's hint, `overview.grid_hint`).
