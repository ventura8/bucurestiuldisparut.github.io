"""The mosaic written in windows (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §19.6): never the whole canvas in memory.

The canvas is a tiled, compressed GeoTIFF (not georeferenced) created paper white. The sheets are pasted one at a time: each reads only its
content box from its own scan, straight at its size on the canvas (GDAL's average, one band at a time into one array,
`raster_io.read_box`), then turned (`Tile`); then the canvas is visited in windows of at most `WINDOW_PX` over the sheet's box, each
read, the pixels this sheet owns set and written back. A pixel belongs to the covering sheet whose centre is nearest (a hard seam, never
a feather: blending line art doubles its lines), worked out per window from the sheets' boxes alone. Peak memory is one sheet at the
canvas's scale, one band and two windows, never a whole scan, whatever the series' size; GDAL's own block cache is held to
`CANVAS_CACHE_BYTES` while the canvas is written, and the C heap's free pages are given back before the first sheet and after each
one (`heap.give_back`: with GDAL's threads, the layout's reads and each sheet's stayed resident in their malloc arenas, 870 MB
against the 800 MB budget for two 12,000 px colour sheets on 16 threads; 653 MB now).
