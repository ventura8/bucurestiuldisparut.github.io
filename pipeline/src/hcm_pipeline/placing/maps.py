"""The placers of drawn maps (docs/research/M20-import-local.md §3 c, *Atlases and pieces*, *PDFs*): single, atlas and pieces.

A single map is placed by its streets as it is. An atlas's pages (image files, or a PDF's pages taken out with pikepdf) and overlapping
pieces are first assembled into one canvas in the job's scratch folder (`assemble`, `joins`), then placed as one map: many junctions
over the whole city are far stronger than page by page. Pieces are joined by their features at a higher resolution (`joins`); when the
archive holds a complete smaller-scale overview of the same area, pieces are laid on that overview first (`overview_find`) and that
mosaic is the series' picture. An atlas's pages join by their edges, or by their overlaps when those join more pages (M22 §4.1). A PDF
that needs a password waits for a person (`low-confidence`: the owner exports its pages). Pages or pieces that join nothing are left
out: the job's log says how many, and the version's placed count leaves them out. A map or canvas that is not placed on its own is kept
as the one stitched picture the Help calibrate wizard places (`stitched`), with the parts left out and why. Every placer swaps a PDF for its
pages before it reads anything, the overview search included: GDAL never opens a PDF (the 1923 plan-ghid atlas failed there, 2026-11-12).
