"""`extract` for a Landsat scene: the bands the true colour needs, and nothing else (docs/research/M25-landsat.md §3).

A Collection 2 Level-1 product bundle is a tar of one GeoTIFF a band (`LT05_L1TP_183029_19890712_20200916_02_T1_B3.TIF`), the quality
band (`..._QA_PIXEL.TIF`) and text files. It is streamed front to back (`tarfile` `r|*`: plain or compressed, never extracted to paths);
each needed band becomes `work/{city}/{job}/bands/{band}.tif`: blue, green and red (B1, B2, B3) and the quality band for Landsat 4 and
5 TM, and the 15 m panchromatic band (B8) besides for Landsat 7 ETM+; Landsat 8 and 9 OLI number them one higher (blue B2, green B3,
red B4; B1 is its coastal band) and have the same B8. A bundle without one of them fails with
`apiError.imagery.missingBand {band}` (the first missing one; the delivery stays: it is what USGS has); an unreadable bundle fails with
`apiError.imagery.archiveCorrupt` and is deleted, so a retry fetches it again.
