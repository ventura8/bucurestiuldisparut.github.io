"""A Landsat scene's colour on the tile grid (docs/research/M25-landsat.md §3): masks, pan-sharpening and the per-scene stretch.

Pure arrays, so every rule is tested without GDAL. The quality band (`QA_PIXEL`, Collection 2 for Landsat 4 to 9: the same bits) marks fill (bit 0),
dilated cloud (1), cloud (3) and cloud shadow (4); a pixel is valid when it is no fill and every colour band has a value (0 is no data in
a Level-1 product; OLI's are 16 bits, which the per-band stretch takes as they come). An ETM+ or OLI scene is pan-sharpened by the
Brovey ratio: each colour band scaled by the panchromatic band over the mean of
the three, so the 15 m band brings its detail and the colour stays the 30 m bands'. The stretch is per band, between robust percentiles
of the clear pixels only (haze and clouds do not set the white point; a scene with no clear pixel falls back to every valid one), to
1..255, so the alpha band alone says where the image is.
