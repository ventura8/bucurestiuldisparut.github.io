"""The C heap given back between large steps (docs/research/M26-governor.md §4, *The C heap*; lesson of 2026-11-13).

GDAL's worker threads (`GDAL_NUM_THREADS` above 1: the governor gives the worker the cores but one) allocate their blocks from
glibc's per-thread arenas, and glibc keeps an arena's freed pages for the next allocation instead of returning them. Measured on
the NUC, two 12,000 px colour sheets laid out and mosaicked: one thread peaked at 636 MB; with every core 870 MB, against the
800 MB budget, because about 115 MB of the layout's reads stayed resident in the threads' arenas and the canvas's own reads added
their own. With at most `ARENAS` arenas and the free pages trimmed after the layout and after each sheet (`give_back`): 587 MB
on one thread, 615 on four, 666 on sixteen, the same pixels and no slower.

`limit_arenas` runs once at the process's start (`python -m hcm_pipeline`: the worker and the Cloud Run job), before GDAL starts
its threads; the canvas gives the heap back before its first sheet and after each one (`placing/canvas_window.render`).

Both calls are glibc's (`mallopt(M_ARENA_MAX)`, `malloc_trim(0)`); on another C library (musl, macOS) they do nothing. The pipeline's
image preloads tcmalloc (GDAL's base image, for the large warps), which serves every `malloc` instead of glibc: there `give_back` also
asks tcmalloc to release its free pages (`MallocExtension_ReleaseFreeMemory`, found in the process when tcmalloc is loaded).
