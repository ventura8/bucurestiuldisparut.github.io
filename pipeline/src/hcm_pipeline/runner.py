"""`python -m hcm_pipeline run`: one execution of a raster job (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §4.4-§4.5, §5.2).

It takes the lease, validates the job, then walks the job type's pipeline steps in order: a step recorded `done`
or `skipped` whose output still exists is passed over, so a retry or a resume continues where the job stopped.
How a run ends:

| Ending | The job | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| every step done | `awaiting_approval` (`waitReason: 'approval'`), lease released | 0 |
| every step done of a side job (`SIDE_JOB_TYPES`: M12's `layer-tiles`) | `succeeded`, lease released | 0 |
| a step waits | `waiting_usgs` with `retryAt`, or `awaiting_gcps`; the step `pending` | 0 |
| a step fails | `failed` with `error {code, message, params}`; the version `failed` | 1 |
| an invalid job | `failed` with `apiError.invalidRequest` (a retry cannot help) | 1 |
| a job type this image does not run | `failed` with `apiError.imagery.pipelineOutdated` (an updated pipeline's retry runs it) | 1 |
| a step declines (M16: a refine with nothing better, `DeclinedError`) | `cancelled` with its `error`; the version `cancelled` with it | 0 |
| `cancelRequested` (heartbeat, a checkpoint, or SIGTERM after it) | `cancelled`; the version `cancelled`; its `work/` objects deleted | 0 |
| SIGTERM (or SIGINT: a local worker's Ctrl-C), no cancel | `queued` with `retryAt` + 1 minute; the step `pending` | 0 |
| the owner paused the job (`paused`, seen before a step starts) | `queued`, held by its `paused` until Resume; no step changed | 0 |
| this computer was paused (`releaseRequested`, or the worker's own pause) | untouched but the step `pending`; `released` queues it | 0 |
| the download phase done on the small `fetch` job | `queued`, lease released: dispatched again on `std` or `xl` | 0 |
| another live owner holds the lease, or the job is not runnable | untouched | 0 |
| M20: an archive series without its sheets here nor a copy (`ArchiveElsewhereError`) | untouched; `returned` queues it | 0 |

A side job works beside its version and never decides its state: its failure or its cancellation leaves the version where it stands.

Local scratch files live in a temporary folder removed whatever the ending. A step whose recorded output is gone runs
again, except what only feeds `locate` once `locate` is finished: `fetch` (`locate` deletes the delivery:
docs/research/M7-local-worker.md §5), `extract` and `stitch` (their `work/` files go with the job's scratch); and `fetch` once
`extract` is finished: the segments outlive the delivery by a week, and nothing else reads it.

An import runs in two phases (finding 56 of 2026-11-01): a run on the small `fetch` job does the download phase
(`DOWNLOAD_STEPS`, network-bound) and hands the job back, queued, for its processing on `std` (or `xl`); a run on a
larger job (or one no dispatcher sized: a local worker) does whatever is left. The version records which job each phase
ran on (`machines.download`, `machines.process`).
