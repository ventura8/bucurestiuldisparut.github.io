"""The worker's loop (docs/research/M7-local-worker.md §1.2).

While a session is held: `worker.claim {cityId, workerId}` every `pollSeconds`, less often once idle for a while (`pace.py`;
a claim also tells the server the worker is alive); a claimed job runs at once, one at a time, with the normal runner
(`runtime.py`); then `worker.end` reports
`done` whatever state the run left the job in, or `failed` with the error when the run crashed outside a step (the
server fails the job if the worker still holds it). A job the server says this worker no longer holds, or a session
that ended, stops the run where it is without another write (a lost lease to the runner). SIGTERM or Ctrl-C: between
jobs the loop ends; during a run the step stops at its next checkpoint and the job goes back to `queued` (the runner's
path), then the loop ends; the process exits 0. One signal is enough at any moment: the runner's handler tells the
loop's (a signal after the run's last checkpoint was once lost), and the loop's takes no lock (docs/LESSONS.md 342).
Finding 67 of 2026-11-02: without a session each pass first lets the connector try (the command's pairing code, or the
session kept in the work folder); a call answered `apiError.worker.revoked` (Disconnect this computer) ends the session
and deletes the kept one; a claim answered `outdated` (the pipeline was updated in the admin) is said on the page.
A claim names the job types this image runs (`RUN_JOB_TYPES`): a newer type stays queued for an updated worker, not failed here.
W5 (household computers): a claim also says the governor's share (`share`), so the server leaves a job to a calmer computer.
M20 (2026-11-13): a claim also names the local archives this computer holds whole (`archives`); its answer may instead be
`copy`, a series another worker waits for, whose sheets this computer sends through the bucket (`copier`, `archive/copy.py`)
before its next claim; a run that finds neither the sheets nor their copy ends `returned`, and the server queues the job again
unspent, waiting for that copy.
Finding 72 (the starter file, M7 §1.5): under the starter's supervisor (`supervised`) an outdated claim ends the loop
instead (`outdated_exit`), and the command exits with `ExitCode.OUTDATED`, so the supervisor pulls the installed image.
Each pass that holds a session sweeps the work folder after its claim (`sweep`, `runtime.py`), told the job it claimed.
