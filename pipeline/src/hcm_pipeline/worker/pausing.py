"""Pause this computer (the owner's request of 2026-11-13; docs/research/M7-local-worker.md, *Pause*).

The pause is the server's (`cities/{city}/workers/{id}.paused`): the admin sets it with `imagery.pause`, and a person at this computer
with its own page (`POST /pause`), whose command travels with the worker's next `worker.claim` or `worker.end` (`pause`). The worker
mirrors what the claim's answer says (`paused`, or none) into the governor (`Governor.pause` / `resume`), which frees the processor,
memory and graphics card, and into `/state` (`paused`). While paused the loop claims every `pollSeconds` (a Resume in the admin is seen
within one poll) and a running job hands itself back at its next checkpoint (`asked_to_release`, `worker.end` `released`).

A command from the page applies here at once, before the server knows it: the claim that was already on its way when it came is not
mirrored (its answer predates the command), the next one carries it.
