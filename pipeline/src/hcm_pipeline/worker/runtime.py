"""One claimed job run on the computer: the runner of `run`, with the worker's ports (docs/research/M7-local-worker.md §1.3).

The job's configuration (its id, the city, the lease owner `worker:<workerId>` the claim wrote) and its services: the
documents through `worker.step`, the objects routed between the work folder and signed URLs, USGS through the server,
no secret at all; the delivery's download, STAC and Overpass as `run` builds them, behind the same address guard (and,
under `--emulators`, sealed to this machine). The steps are the pipeline's own, unchanged.
