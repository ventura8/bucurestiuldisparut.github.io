"""The local matcher's files in the volume `hcm-ai-files` (docs/research/M10-local-ai.md *Delivery*).

Nothing downloads until a frame needs it. Each file of `matcher/pins.json` comes from its upstream behind the address guard and a host
allow-list, every hop of a redirect included, hashed while it streams and renamed only on a match; one that does not match is deleted and
fetched once more, then the matcher stands aside for this run. Weights stay as they are (the sidecar hashes them again at load), and
each run hashes them here first: a file altered after the first use is placed again from what was fetched, so the fault heals by itself.
A wheel or the LightGlue tarball is opened as data, never run through pip: only named members leave it, each written under `lib/` by its
own name, so no path in an archive decides where a file lands. Of LightGlue only `aliked.py`, `lightglue.py`, `utils.py` and `LICENSE`
leave: upstream's `superpoint.py` is headed confidential, and upstream's `__init__.py`, which imports it, is replaced by ours.

Two kinds of sidecar (M26 item i, `docs/research/M26-governor.md` §5): on a computer with an NVIDIA card the starter runs PyTorch's own
image (about 10 GB) with `pins.json`'s files in `lib/`; on one without (`HCM_AI_VARIANT=cpu`, set by the starter) it runs the worker's
own image, and `pins-cpu.json` adds PyTorch for the processor and what it imports, about 0.9 GB unpacked in `lib-cpu/`: a folder of its
own, so the card's image never imports the processor's PyTorch.
