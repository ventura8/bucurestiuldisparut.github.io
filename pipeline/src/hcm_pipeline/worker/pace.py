"""How often an idle worker asks for a job (reports/resource-audit.md §4: every 30 s for ever was 86,400 calls a month a worker,
each with its Firestore reads, for nothing).

Awake, the worker claims every `pollSeconds`: for `AWAKE_SECONDS` after it started, after a job it ran, and after the admin's page
looked at it (`GET /state` from a Hosting origin: somebody is there, and may start a job). Past that, each idle pass waits twice as
long as the one before, up to `idlePollSeconds` of `worker.hello` (a minute: a new job never waits longer), a tenth more or less
so that workers do not ask together. A server that names no `idlePollSeconds` (one older than this image) is asked every
`pollSeconds` as before. Its admin counts a worker gone after three minutes of silence.
