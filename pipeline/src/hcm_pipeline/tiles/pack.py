"""One PMTiles v3 archive from a `{z}/{x}/{y}.webp` tree (docs/research/M12-own-tiles.md), standard library only.

The archive is one object in a bucket: a browser reads a tile with one `Range` request and no preflight, where a tree of files
would mean 25,900 objects, a signed address and two Class A operations for each. The layout follows the PMTiles v3 specification:
a 127-byte header, the gzipped root directory, the gzipped metadata, the gzipped leaf directories, then the tiles in Hilbert order
(`clustered`), each entry a run of one. Sizes come from the files' own stat, so the directories are written first and nothing is
held in memory but the entries. A blank tile is simply absent: the reader answers it from the directory, with no request.
