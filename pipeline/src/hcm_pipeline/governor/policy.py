"""Signals to a profile, with hysteresis (docs/research/M26-governor.md §3). One pure function, `decide`, and its small helpers.

- The owner's choice wins over the user's activity: Quiet is always quiet, Full is full while the user works. Auto goes quiet within one
  tick of input on the host (`idle_s` under `ACTIVE_IDLE_S`), of other processes using more than `OTHERS_BUSY_PCT` of the machine, or
  of a switch to battery; it returns to full only after `CALM_S` with none of those.
- Below `LOW_BATTERY_PCT` on battery it pauses, unless the owner allowed work on battery.
- Thermal: at `CPU_HOT_C` on the processor or `GPU_HOT_C` on a graphics card it steps down one level (full to quiet, quiet to paused),
  and steps back up only `COOL_MARGIN_C` below both. Before that the budget's threads already shrink with the heat (`budget.py`,
  from `WARM_C`), so the worker's own load seldom takes the processor there.
