"""The owner's rough points on a whole frame become the city's crop (docs/research/M9-calibration.md §17).

`georef` meets a version whose scan is a whole frame shrunk (`steps/whole.py`) and now holds the admin's points: the points are put on
the film, the film is cut around them with the city window's larger side as margin (a point anywhere in the window keeps the whole
window in), at full resolution, out of the segments `stitch` made of the kept delivery, and the points move into the crop. The version's
scan is the crop from then on, and `georef` goes on with it as with any scan. Points off the scan are refused; segments no longer stored
(they live 14 days, the delivery 7) end the step with what to do: **Locate again** makes them from a kept delivery, else import again.
