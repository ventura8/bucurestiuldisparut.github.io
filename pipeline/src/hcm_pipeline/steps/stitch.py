"""`stitch`: where the segments lie in one frame, its film border cropped (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §5.3).

USGS scans a long film frame in overlapping parts (`_a` to `_n`), in the film's order: left to right on a KH-9 or a Corona
frame, right to left on the 1966 KH-7 strip (lesson 643: its `_b` lies left of its `_a`, and a frame joined the other way
ended at the seam, half the city). Each pair's offset is found by matching the right segment's left strip inside the left
segment's right part (its last `MAX_OVERLAP_SHARE`, finding 76): first on images shrunk to about 2048 rows, then at full
resolution within a few pixels of that, so it is exact within 1 px. The first pair is matched both ways and the better way
holds for the whole frame; a pair that matches under `MIN_PAIR_SCORE` either way is no film's neighbours (a segment of
another frame) and fails the step. The film border (the
unexposed edge and its markings) is cut where the row and column intensity profiles of a shrunk mosaic leave the dark
level. Finding 57 of 2026-11-01: the frame is never joined in memory (a KH-9 panoramic frame was killed at 32 GiB):
the step reads windows and shrunk copies of two segments at a time and writes `frame.json` (each segment's place, and
the exposure's columns when a dark gap parts it from a fragment of the next one) and `frame-preview.tif` (the frame averaged down
to at most `PREVIEW_MAX_PX` on its long side), which `locate` reads.
