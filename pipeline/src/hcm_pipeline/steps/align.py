"""`align`: how far the frames of a join lie apart, and how to close that (docs/research/M8-join-interfaces.md §3).

Each part is warped small over the city's window; who owns each cell gives the seams; tiles along a seam give its offset, and
the offset shared between the parts gives their nodes. The parts are warped again through those nodes and the same tiles measured
once more: a seam the correction did not help keeps its parts as they were, because **no frame shifts unless the measurement says
it helped**. A join closes the gap only: it never improves where the frames are on the ground. The plan is a work file, so a retry
does not measure again.
