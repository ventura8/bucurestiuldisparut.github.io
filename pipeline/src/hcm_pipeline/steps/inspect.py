"""`inspect` (uploads): what the admin's GeoTIFF is (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §5.3, §8.1).

GDAL opens the upload; a geotransform with a CRS, or GCPs with one, is its own georeference (`method:
'embedded'`, then `reference` and `georef` are skipped and the version waits for a click, never published on its
own); anything else is a scan that waits for the admin's points after `reference`. Either way the scan is
written as 8-bit (one band, or three for colour; other types stretched between the 2nd and 98th percentiles),
keeping the upload's own georeference, with its preview.
