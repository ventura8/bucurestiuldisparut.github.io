"""`georef`: automatic GCPs and suggestions, or the fit of the admin's points (M3-interfaces.md §5.6, §6; M4 §2).

A frame `locate` proved (docs/research/M9-calibration.md §7) has its tiles in `calibration.json`: they become its pairs, every fifth cell
a checkpoint set aside before RANSAC; with that file gone, the tiles are measured again on `scan.tif`. The admin's rough points of a frame
nothing proved seed the same measuring: proved, they are replaced by tiles (`how: 'points'`); refused, they are fitted as today. A set
holding automatic pairs is fitted as saved, so a later edit is never overwritten.

A version still on its corner GCPs and not proved (`method: 'corners'`, a USGS import) is matched against the Sentinel-2 window and
OpenStreetMap's lines (`georef/matcher.py`). With at least six confident pairs (`AUTO_GCP_MIN_CONFIDENCE`) the version gets its
`georef` (`poly2` from 12 well-spread pairs, else `affine`; a fifth held out as checkpoints from 15) and the weaker pairs are its
`suggestions`; with fewer, every candidate is a suggestion and the job waits for the admin's points (`awaiting_gcps`, the version
`needs_gcps` with `apiError.imagery.noMatch {pairs}`, the confident count, or `apiError.imagery.noSpread {pairs}` when enough
confident pairs lie almost in a line), which is not a failure (`georef/autogcp.py`). The corner pairs of a guess nothing confirmed
(`weakCorners`) go then: kilometres off, they would spoil the admin's fit (3.3 km of error at 8 hand-read points of the 1972
frame, 0.4 km without them) and could be saved alone. A version that holds the admin's points (or any other method) is only fitted
with its own transform, and its suggestions are done with; an automatic fit met again (a retry after this step) is fitted the same
way and keeps its suggestions: the corner GCPs a new match starts from were replaced by it, and the georeferencer still offers
those pairs. A scan without any georeference waits for points; an upload's own georeference needs none (`skipped`).
