"""`merge`: the used frames warped and composited into `warped.tif` (docs/research/M8-join-interfaces.md §3).

Each part goes from its own `scan.tif` through its plan, one resample only, at the camera's zoom, one at a time. Tones are evened
out on a small level, the owners give the weights, and the blocks are composited with one block in memory. The result is grey and
last-band alpha like a `warp`'s, so `export` and `register` run unchanged; its alpha counts the union once, so the compute-unit
estimate is right. The report (`version.join`) names the worst frame's own checkpoint figures: **joining does not improve them**.
