"""What several steps share: the city window, the cached references, the scan preview and GDAL error handling.

The references (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §5.5) are cached in the private bucket by window: Sentinel-2 as
`reference/{city}/s2/{key}.tif` (the key: FNV-1a of the window and every candidate's item ids; the reference guard's
verdict, `agreement.py`, in its metadata) and OpenStreetMap as
`reference/{city}/osm/{key}.geojson`; `locate` scores the corner guess against the first, `reference` draws both
for the georeferencer and `georef` matches against the first.
