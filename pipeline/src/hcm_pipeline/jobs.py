"""What a pipeline step runs with and returns (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §5.2).

A step gets a `JobContext` (the configuration, the services, the job and its layer version, a scratch folder,
the run's flags and the job log) and returns `Done` (with its recorded output), `Skipped` (the job does not need
it) or `Waiting` (the job waits on USGS or on the admin's points; the run then exits 0), or raises
`StepFailedError` with an `apiError.*` code. Long work calls `ctx.checkpoint()` (and passes `ctx.gdal_progress`
to GDAL) so a SIGTERM, a cancellation or a lost lease stops it at the next checkpoint. A transfer reports its bytes
with `ctx.report_bytes` (finding 55 of 2026-11-01: a long download looked stuck).
