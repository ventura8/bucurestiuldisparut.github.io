"""Prove: the gates a frame's tiles must pass before anything trusts them (docs/research/M9-calibration.md §4).

Accepted only when every gate holds; `refusal` names the first that fails. Every fifth cell of tiles is set aside before the **last**
RANSAC, and only its strongest tile, by what the match itself shows (never the fit), checks the map fitted on the rest. `refine.py`'s 11
to 12 m cross-validated RANSAC's own inliers, capped at 25 m: that flatters. What the figure does not do: the earlier rounds of
`measure` refit on every tile, held ones too, and centre the last search on that map, and a tile either side of a cell's border can
share half its pixels with a check (a tile is 900 m at a 450 m step, a cell 1,600 m with no buffer). Simulated, that does not flatter a
poly2 figure at this leverage (16.73 m against a true 16.97 m), but it means a tile with no peak is never a gross check: `rival.py` looks
for those.
