"""A panoramic strip searched where the city lies along it, not as one frame (docs/research/M9-calibration.md §16).

A Corona frame (KH-4, KH-4A, KH-4B) is a strip about 17 by 230 km on the ground, 137 350 by 9288 pixels scanned. Its four corners give
no homography: a corner quad that is not a parallelogram makes one bend the strip's long axis as a perspective would, kilometres off and
tens of percent out of scale a hundred kilometres from its ends, and nothing of the 1966 frames F046 and F047 agreed (2026-11-09: `not
proved (no-votes)`, a crop of 137 350 by 9288 pixels). Along the strip a place on film is about linear in the footprint's long axis, and
across it the film holds the whole width. So each orientation puts the city's window at a share of the strip's length; the film's
columns from `STRIP_MARGIN_GROUND_M` before it to as far after are the window searched, with a local map that runs linearly along the
footprint's long edges (the strip stored reversed is another orientation, so both places are searched). Windows that overlap are one.
The existing chain (votes, proof, local AI) runs inside each in turn: the first proved ends it, else the best-voted is kept.

A footprint that puts the city on no part of the strip under any orientation slides `SLIDE_GROUND_M` windows, half overlapping, along
the whole strip, each assumed to hold the city: votes and proofs only, the local AI asked of none (it would run once a window).
