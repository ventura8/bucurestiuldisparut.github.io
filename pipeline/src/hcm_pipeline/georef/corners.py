"""The corner guess of `locate` (docs/research/M3-interfaces.md §5.4).

The scene's four geographic corners give the frame's footprint, but the film's first pixel row may lie at any of
them (forward or aft camera, the flight's direction), so each of the eight assignments of the frame's pixel
corners to the geographic ones (four rotations, each mirrored or not) gives a projective transform; each is scored
by the normalized correlation of the frame warped onto the city window at 60 m against the Sentinel-2 reference at
60 m, and the best one is kept. It maps the city window back into frame pixels: that crop is the scan, and four
GCPs at the crop's corners start the georeferencing.

Findings 62 and 63 of 2026-11-02 (a KH-9 Hexagon panoramic frame, a 1:12 strip): the best of the eight scored a
correlation of 0.03, a quarter turn, and was cropped anyway; the quarter turn stretched the window across the strip's
whole length (a scan over the 200 000 pixels a version may hold, which the admin then could not read) and its scan
matched nothing. Now an assignment whose ground pixel is far longer one way than the best-shaped assignment's is not
scored (`MAX_ANISOTROPY`: a quarter turn or a transposition of a strip); a guess under `MIN_CORRELATION` is searched
again over a window widened by `SEARCH_MARGIN` on every side (the frame warped onto it, the city's reference matched
inside it, the guess moved by the best match's offset: metadata corners are often kilometres off).

The rehearsal on the real 1972 frame D3C1202-200149F039 (lesson 361): a panoramic frame's corners give no homography, so a camera
with a half angle starts from `georef/panoramic.py`'s local fit. M9 (docs/research/M9-calibration.md): which orientation is true and
where the frame lies is `calibrate/`'s to find and prove; here are only the orientations, the crops and what reaches the window. A frame
nothing proves is no failure: `bounded_crop` holds the window with `UNPROVEN_MARGIN_M` under the orientations that reach it, cut to
what a scan may hold, and the admin places the points. `CityNotFoundError` is left for a frame whose exposure does not reach the
window under any assignment: a panoramic camera's dark gap and the next exposure's fragment are no ground of this frame.
