"""A local worker in a process of its own, stopped by one signal (`tests/integration/test_worker_stop.py`; M7 §1.2 step 6).

The worker's real loop, its real signal handlers and the real job runner (with its own handler), in the main thread of
this process as `python -m hcm_pipeline worker` runs them; the callables answered in memory (one claim of a re-georeference
job, then none, every `poll_seconds` of 30 s), the documents in a `MemoryStore`, the steps scripted. At the `moment` the
test names, the process says so on stdout (`AT <moment>`) and waits for a line on stdin, the way a network call holds the
main thread: the test sends its one signal meanwhile, then the line. When the loop ends the process prints the job's status
(`JOB <status>`) and exits 0; a signal the worker lost leaves it claiming every 30 s, which the test sees as a timeout.

Moments: `claim` (the claim of the job is under way: no step may run), `step` (inside the `warp` step: the run goes back to
`queued` at its next checkpoint), `tail` (after the run's last checkpoint, its final write made: the signal once got lost
there, docs/LESSONS.md 342) and `idle` (between jobs).
