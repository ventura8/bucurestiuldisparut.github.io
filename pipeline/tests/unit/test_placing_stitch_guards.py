"""What keeps a doubtful layout from being mosaicked, and the owner's answer read for what it still says (M20 §19.5, §19.6, §19.8).

The adversarial review of track/autostitch (2026-11-13): sheets named right whose seams say nothing were judged `good` (each held by
its cell's prior alone); the older joins mosaicked a `poor` layout unchecked; a sheet the owner did not name became `not-part`; a seam
answered before a sheet moved, or with a malformed point, became a fixed seam; a turn the cell's shape refuses was squashed into it.
