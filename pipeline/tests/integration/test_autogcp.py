"""Automatic GCP suggestions through the `georef` step (scenario P03; docs/research/M4-interfaces.md §2.1-§2.4).

Each test seeds a USGS import whose scan is the synthetic world through an exact affine map (`matching.py`), degraded
the way the scenario says, and runs the real step against the loopback fakes; the fit is then measured against the
exact map over the whole scan, so "placed within the tolerance" means the truth's: the median distance within
`EXPECTED_RMSE_M` and the largest (a corner, outside the hull of the matched pairs, where `poly2` extrapolates) within
`EDGE_ERROR_M`. The approval policy reads the checkpoint RMSE of interior pairs, so the edges are pinned here
(the 2026-10-24 review measured 14.1, 11.7 and 23.4 m; `DECISIONS-for-review.md` §57d).
