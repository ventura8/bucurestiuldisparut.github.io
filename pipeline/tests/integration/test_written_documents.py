"""Every document the pipeline writes has a shape the shared schemas were shown (finding 62 of 2026-11-02).

The live KH-9 import left a layer version the admin could not read ("This could not be read (invalid-document)", Work
0): the pipeline wrote what `layerVersionDocSchema` refuses, and the golden documents of `pipeline/tests/contracts/`
were written by hand, so nothing compared what the writers really produce with the schemas. Here the real runner and
steps run the imports' paths through every state (awaiting approval, the download handed over, USGS preparing, a failure
with parameters, a corrupt archive, cancelled, no pairs, corners kilometres off, a weak guess, the city off the frame) against the
loopback fakes, and every job, version and log document is recorded after each write. Its **shape** (every field path
with its JSON type, list items merged) must be one of the shapes of `contracts/written-documents.json`, whose documents
`packages/shared/test/schemas/pipeline-contract.test.ts` parses with `jobDocSchema`, `layerVersionDocSchema` and
`jobLogDocSchema`. A writer that adds or changes a field fails here until the file is written again:

    HCM_WRITE_CONTRACTS=1 python -m pytest -c pipeline/pyproject.toml --rootdir . pipeline/tests/integration/test_written_documents.py

then `npx prettier --write pipeline/tests/contracts/written-documents.json`, and the TypeScript test says whether the
schemas accept it. Value limits (a scan side, a GCP's pixel) are the
writers' own checks (`steps/locate.py` `within_limits`, the contract's `MAX_SCAN_PIXELS`).
