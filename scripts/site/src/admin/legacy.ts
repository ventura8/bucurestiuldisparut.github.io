/**
 * The legacy Bucharest bundle the admin build ships for the Setup Assistant's import step (docs/research/M2b-interfaces.md
 * §3.3 h, `DECISIONS-for-review.md` §23d), below the admin's `dist/`:
 *
 * ```text
 * legacy/bucharest/city.json              the seed manifest's city, without its Mapbox token and analytics ids
 *                                         (the fields `setup.createCity` takes, CR-M2b-1), plus the imagery settings of
 *                                         scripts/seed/bucharest.city.json: the manifest is the viewer's, it holds none (M8);
 *                                         that file's About, credits and privacy replace the migrated ones, which
 *                                         `seed/bucharest/` keeps as they were (they said "coming soon" and GitHub Pages)
 * legacy/bucharest/photos.json            migrateLegacyPhotos(photos.legacy.geojson): [{sourceFile, legacyId?, photo}], the
 *                                         seed's records first, then each addition's (SEED_ADDITIONS), each corrected by
 *                                         the additions' corrections.json (the old site's later place and direction)
 * legacy/bucharest/corrections.json       those corrections, keyed by photo id: the import applies them to the photos a
 *                                         project already has, where the owner never changed the place or direction
 * legacy/bucharest/originals/<sourceFile> each original a record names, once (the import uploads them; photos.onUpload
 *                                         makes the public derivatives, so nothing is upscaled)
 * ```
 *
 * The additions (`docs/research/M5-interfaces.md` → *The 2023 additions*) are the photos the old site gained after the
 * legacy seed was taken, kept in their own folder because `seed/bucharest/` stays as migrated: their ids keep clear of
 * the seed's (`migrateLegacyPhotos`' reserved ids, as `migrate-legacy.mjs --joins` gives them), so the import of a
 * project that already has the 45 adds only the new ones. The city's credits name every photo's author, the additions'
 * too (`creditsNamingAuthors`).
 *
 * Hosting serves the files; the admin fetches them only during an import.
