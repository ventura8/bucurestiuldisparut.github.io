/**
 * The old admin addresses on the Hosting site's root (docs/research/M6-interfaces.md §2.7, behaviour A58): before M6 the
 * admin was the whole site, so a bookmark, a notification already on a device or an invitation names
 * `https://<project>.web.app/#/<route>`. Since M6 the root is the public map and the admin lives at `/admin/`. The root's
 * page (in both variants, the public map and the start-up page) loads `admin-redirect.js` first, before Mapbox GL and the
 * engine: an address whose hash starts with `#/` (an admin route) is sent to `/admin/` with the same query and hash
 * (`location.replace`, so Back does not come back to it). A viewer hash (`#15.5/44.4271/26.0853/90/!a3!p2`, the old
 * site's; `#17/44.43/26.1&photo=…`, the engine's; `#photo=…`) never starts with `#/` and is left alone, so the map opens.
 *
 * Written like the admin's push service worker (`../admin/service-worker.ts`): `forwardOldAdminAddress` is typed, linted
 * and tested, and the file is its source text called on the page's `window` (Node strips the types when the build runs).
