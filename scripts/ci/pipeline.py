"""Quality pipeline: the single definition of every stage and gate.

Runs only inside the pinned quality image (docker/Dockerfile.quality sets HCM_TEST_IMAGE=1);
scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh starts the container and scripts/ci/in-container.sh calls

    python3 scripts/ci/pipeline.py --stage <static|tests|e2e|tour-matrix|build|sonar|deps|release|contract|quality|all>

The gates of a stage run from the repository root, several at once (scripts/ci/gate_runner.py: at most
PIPELINE_JOBS, default the number of CPUs; a gate waits for the gates in its `needs`, and an `exclusive` gate runs
alone). Their output is printed gate by gate in registry order, each block announced as `static 3/51 eslint` and
closed by `  eslint passed in 27.0s`, so the log reads like a serial run. Every gate runs even after a failure, so
one run lists every problem. A gate that already ran in an earlier stage of the same run (`pytest` and `e2e-matrix`
in `quality`, also `e2e-build` in `all`) is not run again: its outcome is reused. The run ends with
`[SUCCESS] stage 'static' passed` (exit 0, and reports/pipeline/green-static.json records HEAD and a hash of
`git status`) or `[FAILURE] stage 'static' failed: ...` (exit 1), with the failures in registry order.

Extending the pipeline (docs/research/M0-handoff.md): add a `Gate` to `GATES`, then its name to
a stage in `STAGES`. `validate_registry()` (run first, and by the tests) rejects unknown names and
needs that do not come earlier in a stage.
