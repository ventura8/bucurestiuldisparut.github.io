"""Build-stage gate: the shipped bundles stay within their gzip budgets.

Every city page downloads the engine before it can show a map (the city pages load the ES module
build, a third-party embed may load the IIFE from jsDelivr), so their compressed size is a product
property, measured the way a CDN serves it (gzip, level 9). Mapbox GL is not part of it (it is
loaded from api.mapbox.com as the global `mapboxgl`, never bundled), which is exactly what a
sudden jump here would reveal.

The engine's ES module build has lazy chunks too (swipe compare, the consented Firebase SDK): each has its own budget
in `ENGINE_CHUNK_BUDGETS`, and a chunk without one fails.

The admin is an ES module entry with lazy chunks (DECISIONS-for-review.md §34b): each editor area,
Terra Draw, the colour library and the analytics SDK are fetched when first needed. Its budget has
three parts:

- the entry: `admin.mjs` and every chunk it imports statically, which the browser loads before the
  admin shows anything (`ADMIN_ENTRY_KB`);
- every other chunk, by its name without the content hash, against its own budget
  (`ADMIN_CHUNK_BUDGETS`); a chunk without a budget fails, so a new chunk is a reviewed decision;
- everything together (`ADMIN_TOTAL_KB`), so many small chunks cannot grow unnoticed.

The in-app installer's bundle (M6, docs/research/M6-interfaces.md §1.3) is checked apart, with `--install`, once
`build:install` has written it into the Hosting tree (`dist/hosting/admin/install/<slug>/`): its four tarballs are gzip
already, so each is measured as it is served, against `INSTALL_BUDGETS` (KB).

`BUDGETS` holds the budget of each single-file bundle; `--budget FILE=KB` overrides or adds one for
a run. Raising a budget is a reviewed change to these tables, with the reason in the commit, never
a way to get a build green. A missing bundle is an error: the gate runs after `vite-build`.

Usage: check_bundle_budget.py [--root DIR] [--budget FILE=KB ...] [--install]. Exit status: 0 OK, 1 over
budget or missing, 2 usage.
