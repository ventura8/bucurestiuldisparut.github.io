"""How much runs at once, from the memory that is free as well as the cores (the owner, 2026-11-12: ESLint on four workers took
12 GB on a 31 GB laptop and the desktop ran out of memory).

    python3 scripts/ci/parallel.py <lint|gates|vitest|playwright>      prints one number

| kind | default | what it sets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lint` | a quarter of the CPUs; one worker, and one more per 5 GiB available past 9 | ESLint's `--concurrency` (`scripts/ci/lint.sh`) |
| `gates` | the CPUs, one per 2 GiB available | how many gates of a stage run at once (`PIPELINE_JOBS` still wins) |
| `vitest` | the CPUs, one per 2 GiB available | `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS` |
| `playwright` | half the CPUs, one per 2 GiB available | `HCM_E2E_WORKERS` (`e2e/playwright.config.ts`) |

Always at least one. `HCM_MAX_PARALLEL=<n>` caps every kind; `HCM_LOW_MEM=1` is the low-memory mode (gates one at a time, one lint
worker, two Vitest and two Playwright workers); `HCM_LINT_WORKERS=<n>` sets the lint workers outright. No gate is dropped or relaxed:
only how many things run side by side changes. `/proc/meminfo` inside the container is the host's.

ESLint measured on the NUC (16 threads, the whole tree, the container's `memory.peak`, 2026-11-12): one worker 228 s and 8.8 GB, two
137 s and 14.2 GB, four 103 s and 17.8 GB. Every worker builds its own TypeScript programs of the 24 `tsconfig` projects its files
fall in (typescript-eslint's `projectService`), so the first costs about 9 GB and each further one about 5.
