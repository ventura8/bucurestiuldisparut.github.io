# Runs one pipeline stage with its Playwright runs split between this machine and a second Docker machine reached over
# ssh (the NUC by default), both from this working tree, uncommitted changes included:
#
#   PIPELINE_STAGE=quality bash scripts/ci/e2e-split.sh     # or e2e, tour-matrix, all (the default, as run-all-checks.sh)
#
# Here the whole stage runs through scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh with E2E_SHARD set to this machine's part of every
# Playwright run. Meanwhile the second machine receives the tree (rsync of what git sees: no ignored file, so no local
# secret, no .git, no node_modules) and runs only the stage's Playwright stages (e2e, tour-matrix) with the other part,
# in its own quality image. Both outputs stream with a [local] or [<host>] prefix. Then the second machine's reports
# come back to reports/split/<host>/, the two blob reports of each Playwright run are merged in the image (`playwright
# merge-reports`) into the usual reports/junit/e2e*.xml and reports/playwright*/, and one verdict line ends the run:
# `[SUCCESS] stage '<x>' passed` only when both parts and the merge passed; otherwise `[FAILURE] ...`, exit 1, and the
# stage's green marker is removed.
#
# HCM_SPLIT_HOST   the ssh host (default nuc; empty: this machine only)
# HCM_SPLIT_DIR    the tree's folder on it, under its home (default hcm-ci; a git clone, or created)
# HCM_SPLIT_PARTS  this machine's parts and the remote's; they become E2E_SHARD ranges of every tier but the admin
#                  tier: the remote takes the head of the queue (the long tour tests), this machine the tail (short
#                  functional tests). Defaults, measured (docs/research/pipeline-baseline.md): "2:3" for e2e and
#                  tour-matrix ("1-3/5" there, "4-5/5" here), "1:2" for quality and all, where this machine also runs
#                  static, tests and build first.
#
# The admin tier's locked tests run one at a time on each machine (one Firebase project in its emulators; its content
# tests, a city each, run on every worker), so the admin tier is not counted into those ranges: each machine runs its own part of the admin projects (E2E_ADMIN_PART=1-2/3 on the remote,
# 3/3 here; e2e/split.ts), each with its own emulators, at the same time (docs/research/DECISIONS-for-review.md §32f,
# §33a).
#
# When the host does not answer within 5 s (ssh BatchMode), lacks docker or rsync, or another split holds it (a lock
# folder next to HCM_SPLIT_DIR, stale after two hours), the stage runs here only, exactly as run-all-checks.sh runs it.
# When the connection drops during the run (ssh exit 255), this machine runs the remote's part itself afterwards.
