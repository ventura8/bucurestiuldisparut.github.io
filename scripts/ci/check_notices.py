"""Build-stage gate: each build's THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt lists exactly what the build ships, under a permissive licence.

The engine and the admin builds write THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt beside their entry (scripts/site/src/notices.ts, a
Vite plugin; the user's decision of 2026-10-23, docs/research/DECISIONS-for-review.md §52d). This gate checks the file
against evidence the generator does not write, the build's source maps (`sourcemap: true` in both Vite configs) and
the installed packages:

- every npm package a source map names (a source under `node_modules/`; the package is the folder under the last one,
  named by its own package.json) has an entry with its exact version, the licence id its package.json declares and a
  licence text;
- every entry is either such a package or names the files it was copied for (`File:` lines, the self-hosted fonts), and
  those files exist with the package installed at that version and licence; every font file the build ships is named;
- every licence is on `ALLOWED_LICENCES`, the permissive licences reviewed for the engine (which cities embed) and the
  admin (served from Firebase Hosting); anything else fails until it is reviewed and added here.

Mapbox GL JS is external to both builds (pages load it from api.mapbox.com), so it is in no source map and needs no
entry. The site build copies the engine's folder, notices included, next to each city page.

Usage: check_notices.py [--root DIR]. Exit status: 0 complete, 1 a problem (or a build missing), 2 usage.
