# `npm run lint`: ESLint over the whole tree, as one ESLint process per group of TypeScript projects (2026-11-12).
#
# typescript-eslint's `projectService` keeps every TypeScript program it opens until the process ends, and a test
# project's program also holds its package's sources and those of every package it imports: one process over the
# whole tree held the 21 programs of the 22 `tsconfig` projects at once (no file fell into a default project) and
# peaked at 8.6 GB on one worker, 14.2 GB on two, 17.8 GB on four. One process per group holds only its own: the
# largest group (functions) peaks at 2.9 GB, so one group at a time fits a 4 GB machine. Every rule still runs on every
# file: the groups are disjoint, and the last one is the rest of the tree (`.` without the others), so a new folder is
# linted without an edit here. A group's TypeScript programs are the ones a whole-tree run builds for its files, so the
# type-aware rules see the same types.
#
# How many groups run at once: scripts/ci/parallel.py lint (one per 4 GiB available and per 2 CPUs; HCM_LINT_WORKERS
# sets it, HCM_LOW_MEM=1 runs them one at a time). Extra ESLint arguments are passed to every group.
