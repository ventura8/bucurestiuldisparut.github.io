/**
 * The fixtures of the admin tier (docs/research/M2b-interfaces.md §6.2), on top of every e2e guard of
 * `e2e/support/test.ts` (the firewall, which in the admin projects also forwards the fake upstreams' hosts; the console
 * guard, which expects the probe's 401 and Google's 404 for a resource not created yet; the placeholder guard; the input
 * budget):
 *
 * - `adminWorld` (automatic): takes the admin tier's lease, so one admin test runs at a time across projects and
 *   workers; empties the emulators, both worlds of the fake upstreams and the consent stand-in's records of the test;
 *   signs every persona in to the Auth emulator (`accounts`); with `mapOwner`, records the map as claimed by that
 *   persona. Released at teardown.
 * - options `persona` (`null`: the page opens signed out), `mapOwner` (`null`: nobody claimed the map yet), `invited`
 *   (personas with a pending invitation of the owner) and `admins` (personas who already joined as admins); the last two
 *   need a `mapOwner`.
 * - `storageState`: for a `persona`, Firebase Auth's IndexedDB holding that account, signed in after the seed (so its
 *   ID token carries the claims of `mapOwner`).
 * - `upstream`: the fake upstreams' scenarios, failures and recorded calls (the browser's world and the server's).
 * - `consent`: Google's consent stand-in (the popup an in-app click opens, and what it recorded).
 * - `setupBudget`: the Setup Assistant's input and consent budgets per step.
 * - `serverDeployment`: "not deployed yet" at the network edge.
