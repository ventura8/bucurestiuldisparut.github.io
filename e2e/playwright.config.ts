/**
 * Playwright 1.64 end-to-end configuration (docs/research/design-review-testability.md §4.2-4.3).
 * Runs inside the quality image only: `PIPELINE_STAGE=e2e bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh` (gates `e2e-build`,
 * which builds the engine and the e2e sites into dist/e2e-site, then `playwright`). Paths are relative to this file
 * (the e2e/ workspace); reports land in the repository's reports/ folder, where the CI workflow collects them.
 *
 * Three loopback servers start before the tests (`webServer`, e2e/mock-apis/main.ts): the built sites on
 * 127.0.0.1:4310, the mock APIs on 127.0.0.1:4311 and the e2e Hosting server on 127.0.0.1:4312 (M6: the e2e build's Hosting
 * tree, the public map at its root and the admin's e2e build under /admin/, as Hosting serves it). When the admin or the
 * tour runs, the Firebase emulators too (docs/research/M2b-interfaces.md §6.2) of project demo-hcm (auth, firestore,
 * storage, functions from functions/dist, pubsub, tasks) with the Functions emulator's environment of e2e/admin/world.ts;
 * they count as up once `admin-session` is loaded. The tiers and their projects are e2e/projects.ts; `E2E_TIER` picks them (`smoke,fn`; unset is every push's tiers, `all` adds
 * `tour-matrix`), `E2E_SHARD` splits a run across CI jobs or machines and `E2E_ADMIN_PART` gives a machine its part of
 * the admin projects (scripts/ci/e2e-split.sh, e2e/split.ts).
