/**
 * The browser context's network, decided per request (docs/research/design-review-testability.md §4.2):
 *
 * - loopback (the site and admin servers, the Firebase emulators): passes through; a page's request to the mock APIs
 *   themselves (Google's consent stand-in, `/__oauth/…`) gets the test's id as `x-hcm-test`;
 * - a mocked host (Mapbox, analytics, the CDN, the e2e tile and telemetry hosts), and in the admin projects
 *   (`upstream`) a host of the fake upstreams: forwarded to the mock APIs as `/h/<host><path>`, tagged with the test's
 *   id, and answered from there; nothing reaches the real host;
 * - anything else: aborted (`blockedbyclient`) and recorded, and the test fails at teardown (the firewall).
 *
 * WebSockets get the same rule through `routeWebSocket` (route handlers never see them). A page-level `page.route`
 * a spec registers wins over these context routes, which is how a bad path scripts one response.
