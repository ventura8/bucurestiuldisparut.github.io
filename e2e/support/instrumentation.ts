/**
 * Read-only instrumentation added to every page before its own scripts run (`context.addInitScript`), with no hook
 * in production code (docs/research/design-review-testability.md §4.2):
 *
 * - the **map-instance counter**: `window.mapboxgl` is trapped when Mapbox GL's UMD bundle assigns it, and its `Map`
 *   is replaced by a subclass that counts constructions and `remove()` calls, so a spec asserts one map per view (each
 *   map is a billed Mapbox map load) and that swipe compare creates and destroys its second map. The live maps are kept
 *   in `window.__hcmE2e.maps` so the map helpers (support/map.ts) can read what the user sees: where a coordinate is
 *   drawn on the screen, when the map is idle, which features are rendered. Specs never drive the map through it;
 * - the **engine events**: every `hcm-*` event that reaches `document` (they bubble and are composed) is kept with
 *   its detail, so a spec can wait for `hcm-ready` even when it fired before the spec looked.
