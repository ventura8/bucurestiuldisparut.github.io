/**
 * The approval policy (`docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §7.1; S-A17-*): when the pipeline registers a rendered version,
 * its compute-unit estimate is recorded and it is approved on its own, by `system:imagery`, when the city auto-publishes,
 * the georeference was measured (an upload's own georeference never is: S-A17-BAD-EMBEDDED-GEOREF) and its checkpoint
 * error is within the city's threshold over at least three checks. M9 (`docs/research/M9-calibration.md` §11): those checks must be
 * held out from the fit, or a frame checked only on its own points waits (S-A17-BAD-LEAVE-ONE-OUT), and a USGS frame must cover the
 * city (S-A17-BAD-PART-OF-CITY: half a city would go public). The fit must be the proof's own (S-A17-BAD-NOT-PROVED): the matcher's checks
 * come from pairs its RANSAC already filtered, and a pair an admin disabled after reading its residual is no independent check, so
 * `held-out` alone says little off that path. No check of it may have been dropped as gross, and its tiles must span the frame
 * (S-A17-BAD-CHECKS-DROPPED, S-A17-BAD-UNMEASURED-AREA). A missing figure never approves. Otherwise it waits for Approve. M8
 * (`docs/research/M8-join-interfaces.md` §5): a frame made for a join never approves on its own, whether that join is live or
 * ended (half a city would go public), and a join has its own conditions, every one required: it has no georeference.
