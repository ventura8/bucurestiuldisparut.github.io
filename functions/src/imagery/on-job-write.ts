/**
 * `imagery.onJobWrite` (Firestore trigger on `cities/{city}/jobs/{job}`; `docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §4.2): the
 * dispatcher, acting on transitions only (the job before and after compared), each in its own transaction that reads
 * the job again, so a redelivered event finds the job already moved and does nothing (S-A12-HAPPY-DISPATCH). A job that
 * becomes `queued` is dispatched; a cancellation the admin asks for is carried out; a job that reaches
 * `awaiting_approval` gets the approval policy; a job that becomes `cancelled` (the pipeline's SIGTERM handler, CR-M3-18)
 * has what it still held released. M7 (`docs/research/M7-local-worker.md` §3, §4.2): a queued job whose place the admin
 * changed, or that got the admin's OK past the free tier, is dispatched again; a cloud run that ended is counted into
 * the month's Cloud Run use. M8 (`docs/research/M8-join-interfaces.md` §5): a frame that rendered, or a join published,
 * rewrites the plan of whole-city dates. M9 (`docs/research/M9-calibration.md` §2): a `locate` that ended proved leaves its model
 * for the next frame of its pass.
