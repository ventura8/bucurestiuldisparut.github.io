/**
 * M20 (`docs/research/M20-import-local.md` §15, DECISIONS-for-review.md §204; S-A122-HAPPY-RESTITCH): an archive series that was placed
 * from the owner's pairs on its overview mosaic, with pieces left out of that mosaic, is laid on its overview again in a **new version of
 * the same layer**, the owner's pairs kept. **Locate again** asks it (the published version stays on the map until the new one is
 * approved). The pairs hold because the mosaic's frame is the overview's: the scan's pixels name the same overview pixels before and
 * after (`placing/restitch.py`). The new job runs where the archive's files are (`runOn: 'local'`, as the import's); a series stitched any
 * other way, or with nothing left out, is not offered it.
