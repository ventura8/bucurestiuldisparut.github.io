/**
 * A new rendition of a version's scan (`docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §4.1, §6.4; S-P02-*): new points from the
 * georeferencer, or a crop of the layer. It gets its own `regeoref` job and version on the same layer, built from the base
 * version's scan, reference, label and dates (the pipeline reads the scan, never rewrites it, and calls no USGS). The
 * layer keeps its tiles and shows the version as pending until it is published; a base that was still awaiting approval
 * is replaced (it and its job end, cancelled). The transaction that creates the new version reads the base and the layer
 * again (CR-M3-47): a base the guard sent to Mapbox meanwhile, or a layer another version took, refuses the save
 * (`apiError.imagery.versionState`, `apiError.layers.busy`) instead of cancelling what is already under way. M8: a frame a
 * live join holds gets no new rendition (`apiError.imagery.joinPartHeld`); points on a frame waiting for them continue its
 * own job (`save-gcps.ts`), which is what the join waits for. M18 item 3: it is a re-run, never counted against the day's import
 * limit; only the budget guard is asked.
