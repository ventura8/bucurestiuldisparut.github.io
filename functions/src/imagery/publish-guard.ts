/**
 * The compute-unit guard (`docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §7.2; security review §3.3; S-A42-*): before anything reaches
 * Mapbox, one transaction on `usage/mapbox-YYYY-MM` checks the version's estimate against what the month has left (the
 * budget plus any paid overage, minus what is spent and what other publishes hold) and the account's tileset count.
 * Within: the estimate is reserved and the job moves to `mts_processing`. Over, or at the tileset cap: the version
 * records the verdict and the job waits for the admin's choice. Two approvals at once never both fit the last units:
 * the reservations are in the same transaction (`S-A42-BAD-RACING-PUBLISHES`). The tileset count (CR-M3-47) holds every
 * tileset the account has or is about to have: the layers' tilesets, those of deleted layers still in their grace, the
 * first publishes under way (a version `publishing` for a layer without a tileset) and, read in the same transaction, the
 * reservations of first publishes, so two first publishes at once never both take the last place
 * (`S-A42-BAD-RACING-TILESETS`). M5 (`docs/research/M5-interfaces.md` §1.8; S-A52-BAD-CITY-OVER): a city with limits is
 * also held by its share of the month (`cities/{city}/usage/{month}`, in the same transaction): over it, the version
 * waits with the verdict `city-over` while the other cities' publishes go on.
