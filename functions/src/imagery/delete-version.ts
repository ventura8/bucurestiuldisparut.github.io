/**
 * `imagery.deleteVersion` (an editor or the city's owner; `docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §7.1; S-A125-*): a version that never
 * reached the map goes for good: a failed, cancelled or rejected one, or an archive series waiting for points that the owner starts
 * over (its job is cancelled first, through the same ending as Cancel, so whatever it held is released). Its job, the job's log, its
 * scratch files (`work/{city}/{job}/`) and its own folder of the private bucket (`rasters/{city}/{layer}/{version}/`) go, with a
 * public copy a dead publish left; never the folder of a version it was based on, a USGS delivery, an upload's original or the
 * archive's originals, which stay on the owner's computer. A first import's scene that only a failure kept is freed, as Dismiss does.
 * Refused: a version that is or was on the map (`apiError.imagery.deletePublished`), one whose job is under way
 * (`apiError.imagery.deleteRunning`: Cancel first), one another version is built on (`apiError.imagery.deleteInUse`) and a frame a
 * live join holds (`apiError.imagery.joinPartHeld`). The two documents are deleted in a transaction that reads them again, so a
 * Retry clicked meanwhile is never deleted under its run (a version gone meanwhile is `apiError.notFound`, one that left its
 * deletable state `apiError.imagery.versionState`). An archive series also leaves its archive's record of jobs in the same
 * transaction, so `imagery.archiveImport` takes it again: the owner starts it over (the import's stamp goes with the last series).
 * Layer versions are not audited documents (no `history` subcollection);
 * the deletion is recorded as the structured log line every version decision writes, with the caller's uid.
