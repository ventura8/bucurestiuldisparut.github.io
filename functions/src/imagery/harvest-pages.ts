/**
 * One dataset's search of a harvest, page by page, inside the run's time (lesson 676). The run has three ends (`HarvestBudget`):
 * no page is asked for once `searchEnd` has passed; each page's request gets its own timeout (at most `PAGE_TIMEOUT_MS`, never past
 * `pagesEnd`, which leaves time to store what was found); and the whole run is done by `runEnd`, well inside the callable's 540 s.
 * A search that stops early (out of time, a request that took too long, a page USGS refused) keeps every record it read and says
 * where it stopped (`next`, M2M's `startingNumber`): the dataset is stored at once and the next run resumes it there.
