/**
 * `imagery.retry` (admin; `docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §4.5): a failed raster job again, from its first unfinished
 * step. A pipeline failure goes back to `queued` with its failed steps `pending` (the finished ones are skipped by their
 * recorded outputs; the dispatcher starts a new execution); a failure after approval goes back to the publisher, never
 * to Cloud Run, its MTS job and publish steps cleared (the upload is kept: the same file is not sent twice). At most
 * `JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` executions and `PUBLISH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` publish starts in all; never while the budget guard is red;
 * never a job without its version (an upload the server refused: there is nothing to run) nor a failure no retry can
 * cure (a Mapbox token or its scopes: Setup's Mapbox step; out of memory on the large machine) (CR-M3-47); never a version
 * that ended otherwise: a dismissed one gave its scene and its scratch files back, and a retry would make a layer no scene
 * knows (finding of 2026-11-06; S-A12-BAD-RETRY-DISMISSED). A version still `processing` under a failed job is a stranded run
 * (the runner's second write did not arrive): the retry is the way out, as neither Dismiss nor Cancel takes it
 * (S-A12-BAD-STRANDED-VERSION). A stopped job (status `cancelled`, version `cancelled`) is retried the same way as a failed one,
 * without the Stop that ended it (`cancelRequested`), and its version keeps what the owner gave it: an archive series with saved
 * pairs (`georef`, `method: 'gcps'`) places itself from them again (`placing/owner.py`; S-A12-HAPPY-RETRY-STOPPED-PAIRS).
 * A manual retry of a run on the owner's computer (`runOn: 'local'`, an archive series) is allowed past `JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and
 * starts the count again: it costs no cloud compute (`retryPastCap`; live report of 2026-11-12, S-A12-HAPPY-LOCAL-RETRY-PAST-CAP);
 * a cloud run's cap and every publish cap stay (S-A12-BAD-CLOUD-RETRY-AT-CAP). Checked again in the transaction that retries.
 * M8 (`docs/research/M8-join-interfaces.md` §5): a
 * failed join freed its frames, so its retry asks whether they are still its own (a newer join, new points or a publish of its
 * own may have taken one: `apiError.imagery.joinPartGone`), and it goes back waiting for them, so no worker can claim it before the
 * dispatcher looked; a publish retry needs them all still there.
