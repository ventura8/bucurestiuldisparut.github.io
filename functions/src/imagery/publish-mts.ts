 * The MTS half of the publisher (`docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §7.3): the version's COG streamed from the private
 * bucket into the layer's tileset source (never held in memory; skipped when the same file is already there, or when an
 * earlier attempt of this publish uploaded it), the raster recipe written and the tileset published, then the MTS job
 * polled after 60, 120, 300 and every 900 seconds. The tileset and source ids are deterministic per layer, so a retry
 * never makes a second tileset; the publish call is marked on the job in a transaction first, so a retry that finds the
 * mark without a job id looks for the job Mapbox already started instead of starting (and paying for) another one
 * (CR-M3-47). The tiles token is read from Secret Manager at run time and never logged.
