/**
 * `imagery.locateAgain` (a city editor; `docs/research/M3-interfaces.md` §4.5; S-A69-*): a frame that waits for points under an older
 * pipeline searches for its place again, which **Retry** cannot do (it takes failed jobs only), and which used to cost a cancel, a
 * new download and one of the day's imports. The job goes back to `queued` from `stitch`: what `fetch` and `extract` recorded stands,
 * and the runner passes over each whose output is still stored, makes the segments again from a delivery a weak crop kept, and a
 * `locate` that refused may now prove. `stitch` runs again for the reason a retry's does (finding 78): a frame parked under an older
 * pipeline would be searched on that pipeline's `frame.json` and preview. It is the same job, so `imagery.import`'s daily limit is not
 * asked; each start still counts against `JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (the admin's points get their own run, `imagery.saveGcps`), and the budget
 * guard stops it as any start. The segments live 14 days and the delivery 7: with neither left, the refusal says so instead of
 * downloading again. A job on the owner's computer keeps both there, out of the server's reach: its runner fetches again only if
 * that computer's sweep removed them. A job moved after it parked left its files where it ran (`JobDoc.filesOn`), which the other
 * place cannot read: `apiError.imagery.locateFilesElsewhere` says so, and no download of up to 8.7 GB starts behind the log's back.
 * M18 item 3 (`docs/research/M18-improvements.md`): a frame whose crop failed (its job failed at `stitch` or `locate`) searches
 * again the same way, before anyone imports it anew; and Locate again is free: never the day's limit, and, for a frame parked for
 * points like the admin's points, one run of its own whatever the runs before used (`attemptForSearch`). A failed crop's run counts
 * as a retry's (review of M18: the same failure would repeat without end). `imagery.tick` asks it by itself for every frame parked
 * under an older pipeline image (`relocate.ts`).
