 * project and (M5) fewer than the city's own share (`apiError.imagery.dailyLimit {limit}`), and the layer has no
 * unfinished job (`apiError.layers.busy`). The daily
 * count and the busy check are queries, which a Firestore transaction cannot hold, so two creators racing in the same
 * second may both pass: the cap is a spend guard, not an exact quota. M20's counting transactions (an archive's import, the
