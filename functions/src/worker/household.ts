 * that runs on battery or runs hot (its governor's share, said with each claim: M26) leaves the job to another computer of the
 * city that is calm now: connected, not paused or removed, idle, and at full share. With no calm computer it takes the job
 * anyway, at the governor's quiet pace: a job is never left waiting for a computer that is not there.
