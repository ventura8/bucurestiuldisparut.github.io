/**
 * OpenStreetMap's Nominatim reverse geocoder (M4, `docs/research/M4-interfaces.md` §4.2): one `GET /reverse` of a cache
 * cell's centre (`format=jsonv2`, `zoom` `GEOCODE_ZOOM`, `addressdetails=1`, `namedetails=1`, `accept-language` the
 * language asked), with `NOMINATIM_USER_AGENT` and no credential. Called only by the `assist-geocode` queue's worker,
 * which keeps the whole project at one request a second (Nominatim's usage policy). M5: one `GET /search` of a city's
 * name for New city (`cities.locate`, the project owner's, one call per name the admin stops typing). Adapter
 * `functions/src/adapters/nominatim.ts` (assists-notify); failures are `UpstreamError('nominatim', …)`: a 429 or a 403
 * `rateLimited` (the cool-down follows), a 5xx or a timeout `unavailable`, an unreadable answer `invalid`.
