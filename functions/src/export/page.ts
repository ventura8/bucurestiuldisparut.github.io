 * The export's `index.html` (M5, `docs/research/M5-interfaces.md` §5.1): the starter kit's committed page filled by
 * `fillKitPage` of `@hcm/shared` for the exported city, with the engine beside it (`engine/`, no CDN) and `city.json`
 * next to it. Its meta CSP names the origins the exported manifest still points at (tile servers, a PMTiles archive, a
 * photo kept at an outside address, an https basemap style) besides the fixed Mapbox and engine sources; an origin a
 * policy cannot name as one source (a host with `;` or `'`, which a WHATWG URL allows) is left out, so a city editor's
 * basemap address never adds a directive (`docs/LESSONS.md` 241). The export's manifest carries no analytics id, so
 * the policy names none of the telemetry's hosts.
