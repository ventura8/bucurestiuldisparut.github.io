Read the change with `git status` and `git diff` (Bash is for those two commands and `diff -r` only). Route every changed file through `.agent/skills/governance/agent_asset_maintenance_skill.md` → *Where a lesson goes* and `.agent/skills/governance/doc_update_skill.md` → *Ownership map*, and check:

- `README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `.agent/**`, `.agents/skills/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md`;
- `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` are byte-identical (`diff -r .agents/skills .claude/skills` prints nothing);
- a new or changed gate or stage appears in `scripts/ci/pipeline.py`, `.agent/skills/quality/pipeline_skill.md` → *Stages*, `.agent/skills/quality/ci_quality_gates_skill.md` and `docs/CI_PIPELINE.md`;
- a dependency bump or hold appears in `docs/CI_PIPELINE.md` and `.agent/skills/quality/pipeline_skill.md`;
- a user-visible behaviour change has its rows in `e2e/scenarios.json`;
- a new UI string is in both `packages/shared/src/i18n/ro.ts` and `packages/shared/src/i18n/en.ts`; an admin-facing change is in both `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.ro.md` and `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.en.md`;
- every back-ticked repository path in the changed docs exists or is listed under *Planned paths* in `docs/research/M0-handoff.md`, and a planned path that now exists has been removed from that list;
- `AGENTS.md` is at most 24,000 bytes and every skill at most 500 lines.

Report the files that should have changed and did not, each with the reason. Do not write.
