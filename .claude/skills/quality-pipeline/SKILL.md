Use before claiming any change is done, when a CI job fails, or when adding or bumping a tool.

# Quality Pipeline Skill

`scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh` builds `docker/Dockerfile.quality` as `hcm-quality:local` and runs `scripts/ci/pipeline.py --stage "$PIPELINE_STAGE"` inside it, with the repository mounted at the same absolute path and no host-home mount. CI calls the same script per stage. The host's Node 22 and Python never run a gate.

Canonical stage table (and what `quality` and `all` contain): `.agent/skills/quality/pipeline_skill.md` → *Stages*. Every gate and its fix: `.agent/skills/quality/ci_quality_gates_skill.md`.

## Commands

```bash
PIPELINE_STAGE=static bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh    # docs and tooling changes
PIPELINE_STAGE=tests bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh     # Vitest (node + Chromium) + pytest, 90 % per file
PIPELINE_STAGE=build bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh     # vite build of engine and admin
PIPELINE_STAGE=quality bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh   # what CI runs
PIPELINE_STAGE=quality bash scripts/ci/e2e-split.sh        # the same, Playwright split with the NUC (e2e alone: 7.5 min)
bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh                          # default all: before a push to master or a tag
PIPELINE_STAGE=release bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh   # at a vX.Y.Z tag: versions, release notes, bundles
PIPELINE_STAGE=contract bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh  # deep links and third-party API shapes (network)
PIPELINE_STAGE=sonar bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh     # SonarQube scan and verdict (skips without SONAR_TOKEN or .sonar-token)
PIPELINE_STAGE=deps bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh      # every pin on its latest stable release (network; HELD entries aside)
python3 scripts/ci/pipeline.py --list                      # the registry (safe on the host)
bash scripts/ci/build-and-test.sh                          # rebuild the image only
```

Read the verdict from a log, never through `tail`:

```bash
mkdir -p reports/pipeline
PIPELINE_STAGE=static bash scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh > reports/pipeline/run.log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"
grep -E '^\[(SUCCESS|FAILURE)\]|FAILED' reports/pipeline/run.log
```

One tool while iterating (inside the image):

```bash
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/tmp/hcm-home -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" hcm-quality:local \
  bash -c 'mkdir -p $HOME && npx vitest run --project ui'
```

## Which stage

- Docs or tooling only: `static`. In CI a pull request whose every changed file is Markdown runs only `static` too (the `changes` job of `ci.yml` skips `tests`, `e2e`, `build` and with them `sonarqube`); a push runs everything.
- TypeScript or Python: `static`, `tests`, `build`.
- A user-visible change, `e2e/`, `e2e/scenarios.json`, `sites/`, `starter-kit/` or `scripts/site/`: also `e2e` (`E2E_TIER=smoke,fn` for a quick run; unset runs every push's tiers, every scenario row; `all` and the `tour-matrix` stage add the rest of the tour matrix; `bash scripts/ci/e2e-split.sh` instead of `run-all-checks.sh` splits the Playwright runs with the NUC). The site build's unit tests run in Vitest's `tools` project (gate `vitest` of `tests`); the Pages sites are built by `site-build` in `build`, after `notices` checked each build's `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` against its source maps.
- A Setup Assistant deep link (`packages/admin/src/setup/links.json`) or a third-party probe: `contract`.
- Before a push to `master` or a tag: `all` (the default: `quality` with the `tour-matrix` stage after `e2e`, then `sonar`, which skips with a notice without a token).
- A dependency bump: `static`, `tests`, `build`, then `deps` to see what else is behind; a deliberate hold is a `HELD` entry with its reason in `scripts/ci/check_dependency_updates.py`.

## Adding a gate

1. Pin the tool: exact npm devDependency, an exact line in `scripts/ci/requirements.txt`, or a digest-pinned binary in `docker/Dockerfile.quality`.
2. Add `Gate("<name>", (...))` to `GATES` in `scripts/ci/pipeline.py`; npm tools get a `package.json` script and run as `(*NPM_RUN, "<script>")`.
3. Add the name to its stage in `STAGES` (cheapest first, network-bound last). The gates of a stage run at the same time (`scripts/ci/gate_runner.py`, at most `PIPELINE_JOBS`, output still in registry order): a gate that reads another gate's output gets `needs=("<gate>",)` and comes after it, one that saturates the machine or binds fixed ports gets `exclusive=True`, and tool caches go under `reports/.cache/`.
4. Run the pytest suite in the image: the registry tests reject unknown, duplicated or unstaged gates.
5. Update `pipeline_skill.md`, `ci_quality_gates_skill.md`, `docs/CI_PIPELINE.md` and this skill (then `cp` it to `.claude/skills/quality-pipeline/SKILL.md`).

## Fixing a gate

Never suppress: no inline directive of any tool, no `.skip`/`.only`/`xfail`, no lowered threshold, no exclusion to pass. Split the function, type the value, render with Lit or `textContent`, log through `createLogger` or `scripts/ci/cilog.py`, drive the uncovered branch from outside. A genuine relaxation goes into the tool's single config with a why-comment, and editing a lint config is ask first. An advisory is fixed with `overrides` (or a vendored patch such as `vendor/npm/braces`), never an allowlist.

## Hard-won rules

- Never edit `scripts/ci/run-all-checks.sh` while it runs (bash reads it by offset). When another run may be in flight, replace it atomically: write a temporary file next to it and `mv` it over (the running bash keeps the old inode).
- The quality image sets `LD_PRELOAD=""`: the GDAL base preloads tcmalloc and Chromium aborts under it.
- A new workspace needs a `COPY <dir>/package.json <dir>/` line in the Dockerfile's `manifests` stage, or `npm ci` fails in the image build.
- A dependency change (lockfile, a manifest's dependency fields, `scripts/ci/requirements.txt`) rebuilds the image for three to five minutes on every machine; an npm script edit does not, because the `manifests` stage drops the scripts before the npm layer (keep `emulators:setup`, which that layer runs).
- A split run (`scripts/ci/e2e-split.sh`) gives each machine part of the admin tier's projects (`E2E_ADMIN_PART=1-2/3` on the NUC, about twice as fast, `3/3` here; their locked tests run one at a time against each machine's own emulators, the content tests on every worker) and slices every other tier by `HCM_SPLIT_PARTS` without counting the admin tests (`e2e/split-reporter.ts`), so the two admin parts run at the same time instead of one chain ending the NUC's part.
- `npm install` of a dependency runs in the digest-pinned `node:24-bookworm-slim` image, after `npm view` (`docs/SETUP.md` → *npm in a container*). While other agents run gates in the same tree, write the new `package-lock.json`'s SHA-256 to `node_modules/.hcm-install-stamp` afterwards: `npm install` already brought `node_modules` to the lockfile, and a stale stamp makes the next run's `npm ci` delete `node_modules` under their tests.
- Vite bundles a config's relative imports (`scripts/site/src/css-literals.ts`, `notices.ts`) but leaves their package imports to Node: such a module imports `node:` modules, npm packages and files beside it, never a workspace package such as `@hcm/shared`, whose TypeScript sources import `./x.js` (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`: the first build with the notices plugin, which imported the site build's `errors.ts`).
- A dependency whose npm package ships no `LICENSE` (the Firebase JS SDK's packages, Terra Draw) gets the standard text of its declared licence in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` (`scripts/site/src/licence-texts.ts`); one whose licence has no text there stops the build, and one whose licence is not on `ALLOWED_LICENCES` (`scripts/ci/check_notices.py`) fails the `notices` gate until it is reviewed.
- A browser crash leaves `core.<pid>` in the repository root (git-ignored); delete it.
- Commit subjects are `type(scope): summary` (`scripts/git-hooks/commit-msg` locally, the `commits` gate over the CI range); squash `fixup!` commits before a pull request.
- The image has a real `sonar-scanner` on `PATH`: a test that hides its fake tool must also drop the image's directories from `PATH`.
- e2e specs are linted with `eslint-plugin-playwright`: no conditional in a test body (window-class branches go into helpers such as `closeModalSheet` in `e2e/support/viewer.ts`), assertion helpers are named `expect…`, a test function stays within 120 lines (a journey becomes one function per step).
- A change to `functions/package.json`'s dependencies or to the root `overrides` refreshes `functions/deploy-lock/` (`npm run deploy-lock --workspace @hcm/functions` in the pinned Node image, with the network); the `vite-build` gate fails on a stale lock and `deploy-lock-audit` audits it.
