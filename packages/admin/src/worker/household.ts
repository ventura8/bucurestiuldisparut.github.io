/**
 * W5, household computers (`docs/research/M7-local-worker.md` *Household computers*; the owner, 2026-11-13: "make it easy to use
 * not only their own computer but also the other computers in their household, with minimum input"), in the lazy
 * `worker-household` chunk:
 *
 * - **The city's computers.** Every worker of the city (`cities/{city}/workers`, live): its name (the owner's, else the
 *   computer's own), online or not (seen within `WORKER_FRESH_SECONDS`), what it does, its share of the computer (M26), its
 *   helper's and pipeline's versions. Rename, Pause and Resume are `worker.manage`.
 * - **Remove this computer** (the owner's order: clean up first, disconnect second, no command): `worker.manage` `remove` asks
 *   the computer's worker, at its next claim, to clean the computer up; the list follows its word (asked, cleaning, done, or
 *   failed and why). An offline computer does it when it next comes on. **Disconnect now anyway** is `worker.revoke`, and only
 *   then the list shows the line that cleans the computer up by hand.
 * - **Add another computer.** For a computer with a screen, the address of this admin to open there (sign in, then Use this
 *   computer: the auto-pair does the rest). For one without, one line to paste over SSH that carries a one-time code
 *   (`worker.pairCode` with `household`: 45 minutes, one use) on standard input, never as an argument.
