/**
 * "Use this computer" (finding 72 of 2026-11-02, the user: "I should not have to copy and paste"; the user's decision
 * "Starter file + auto-pair"; `docs/research/M7-local-worker.md` §1.5, §2.7), in the lazy `worker-local` chunk:
 *
 * - **The starter file.** A link gives a small file for this computer's system (Linux `hcm-worker.sh`, macOS
 *   `hcm-worker.command`, Windows `hcm-worker.bat`) as an ordinary download from the server's `worker.starter` (finding 73
 *   of 2026-11-03: Chrome saved nothing of the file this page used to make itself, a Blob behind a link clicked after an
 *   `await`); the file holds no secret. When the panel first shows, one `HEAD` of that address says whether this server
 *   makes the file (`starter`: an older server does not, and the panel says to update the map). Opened once, the file
 *   checks Docker and installs a supervisor of the owner's user that runs the worker in the background and keeps it on
 *   the installed pipeline image. Stop using this computer gives the same file with `uninstall`, and disconnects the
 *   computer's worker (`worker.revoke`).
 * - **Auto-pair.** While the panel is shown or the admin is open (`../app/local-watch.ts`: one instance per city and project,
 *   started by each that shows it), and this browser set the computer up for the city (`LOCAL_KEY`), it looks at
 *   the worker's local state (`GET http://127.0.0.1:8765/state`) every `PROBE_MS`; a worker of this city and project that
 *   is not signed in yet turns the panel to "Connecting this computer…" by itself, and one that takes a code (`pairable`)
 *   gets a fresh one (`worker.pairCode`, posted to `POST /pair`), so nothing is copied or pasted. The worker answers those
 *   two requests for the project's Hosting origins only (CORS, Private Network Access).
 * - **Advanced.** The copyable command of finding 66, with its own one-time code (minted when Advanced is opened, renewed
 *   a minute before it expires).
