/**
 * The admin's key journeys as GA4 events (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → *Field measurements*, the owner's request of
 * 2026-11-12): an import started, a georeferencing saved, a layer approved or rejected, published, joined, a new city.
 * Each is one `admin_action` event when its callable answers: the action's name (`imagery_import`), the outcome (`ok`,
 * or the refusal's code, which names the cause: `apiError.imagery.notReady`) and how long it took. Ids, codes and
 * milliseconds only, never a request's data; sent like every measurement, only after the admin's consent.
