 * The editors' daily flows and how many in-app inputs each may take (`docs/research/M2c-interfaces.md` §5.6; behaviour
 * A30): clicks, fills, file choices and key presses that commit, as the Setup Assistant's `SETUP_STEP_SPECS` count them.
 * The e2e tier reads these (`@hcm/admin/content/budgets`, CR-M2c-11) and fails a flow that takes more
 * (`S-A30-HAPPY-CONTENT`). `perVertex` adds one input per vertex of a drawn shape, `perMove` one per slider moved.
 *
 * Shared by every workstream: one marked section per area (§11.2); a workstream adds its flows inside its own section.
