 * Storage SDK (`getBlob`: the admin's rules allow admins to read, and no address of USGS or of the bucket ever reaches
 * a page as a link). `FilePort` is the Storage adapter (`../firebase/files.ts`); `PicturePort` decodes an image into a
 * canvas (`./pictures.ts`), which the admin map shows as a canvas source: a `blob:` address is no source Mapbox may
 * fetch under the admin's CSP.
