 * pipeline and the site once the server is installed (2026-11-12: a pipeline image that went in before its server made
 * the local worker's claims refused until the server caught up). Finding 65 of 2026-11-02: the same click and consent also apply the
 * Provision items whose definition changed since the project was last prepared (`provisionDue` on the slice; the
