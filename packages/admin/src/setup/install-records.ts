/**
 * Where the install cards' last known states are kept (`docs/research/M6-interfaces.md` §1.7): in start-up mode the
 * bootstrap record's `install` (`sessionStorage`), after the claim `setup/status.install` through `setup.recordCloud`.
 * A record holds a target's state, release (with its build time), build id and reason only: no token, address, secret
 * or log line. A target the cards already observed in this session keeps what they saw when it is newer than the record.
 *
 * A record's state says where the target stood against the admin that wrote it (finding 39 of 2026-11-01: the admin
 * 1.0.0+9e2e6b5 recorded its server `installed`; after the redeploy of 1.0.0+457201e the card still said installed and
 * offered no update). A recorded release in place is therefore read again against this admin's own release and build
 * time (`recordedState`): the same release is installed, an older one an update, a newer one newer than this admin.
