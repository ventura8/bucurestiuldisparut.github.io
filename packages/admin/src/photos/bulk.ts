/**
 * Bulk actions on a selection of photos (`docs/research/M2c-interfaces.md` §1.5, §6.5; behaviours A10, A33): Publish,
 * Unpublish, Confirm rights, Set author, source and licence, Delete. Every document is checked first (the publish gate,
 * `photoDocSchema` over the document as read); the ones that cannot change are listed with their reason and left alone
 * (`S-A10-BAD-NOT-PUBLISHABLE`), the rest are written in Firestore batches of at most 500. A batch is all or none, so a
 * refused batch reports each of its photos.
