/**
 * Library build of the admin app: the ES module entry `dist/admin.mjs`, its lazy chunks next to it and `dist/admin.css`.
 * Hosting serves it under `/admin/` (the base; M6) and the public map at the root (`npm run build:hosting` copies this
 * folder to `dist/hosting/admin/`). The page (scripts/site's admin target) holds `<hcm-admin-shell>` and loads `admin.mjs` as a module
 * script, which starts itself (`src/index.ts`). Each editor area's page and store (`src/pages/<area>.ts`), Terra Draw
 * (`@hcm/ui/map/draw`'s loader), the colour library and the analytics SDK are chunks fetched when first needed
 * (DECISIONS-for-review.md §34b); `scripts/ci/check_bundle_budget.py` measures the entry and every chunk. There is no IIFE:
 * an IIFE inlines every dynamic import, and the admin is not distributed for embedding (the engine's IIFE is, on jsDelivr).
 * Mapbox GL stays external exactly as in the engine build.
 *
 * `dist/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` lists every npm package bundled into the entry and its chunks, and the fonts' packages
 * (scripts/site's admin target copies the fonts next to it), with their licences (`thirdPartyNoticesPlugin`,
 * scripts/site/src/notices.ts; checked by the `notices` gate).
 *
 * The build is minified (DECISIONS-for-review.md §36): its JavaScript like the engine's (`minify: true`, §17a), and the
 * CSS of the Lit `css` templates by `cssLiteralsPlugin` (scripts/site/src/css-literals.ts), since a template literal's
 * text is beyond the bundler's minifier.
 *
 * Modes (`vite build --mode <mode>`, read in the code as `import.meta.env.MODE`):
 * - `production` (`npm run build`): Firebase's Google popup, App Check when `runtime.json` names a site key;
 * - `e2e` (`npm run build:e2e`): Auth, Firestore, Storage and Functions on the emulators of `firebase.json` and the OAuth
 *   stand-in of the mock APIs instead of Google's popup (docs/research/M2b-interfaces.md §2.6). The mode is a constant
 *   for the bundler, so the production build carries neither the emulator settings nor the stand-in's page logic.
