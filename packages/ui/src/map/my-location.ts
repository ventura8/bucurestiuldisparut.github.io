/**
 * The visitor's position on the map ("Show my location", V10): a blue dot with a white ring, a translucent circle as wide as
 * the position's accuracy and, where the device gives a heading, a cone pointing that way. Our own GeoJSON source and two
 * layers on the global `mapboxgl` (nothing bundled), drawn on every map of the view (swipe compare's second map too) above
 * the photos in the `top` slot. They are in no overlay's registry, so a click passes through them. The canvas is not
 * repainted by forced colours: the white ring keeps the dot apart from any basemap, and nothing on it moves by itself.
 * The photo sheet's Show on map draws its ring around a photo's place the same way (`drawPhotoMark`), in the photos' cone
 * colour, on every map of the view too (the state's `photoMark`, drawn by the engine's `MapSync`).
