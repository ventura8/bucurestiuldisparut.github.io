/**
 * The part of Terra Draw 1.37.0 and `terra-draw-mapbox-gl-adapter` 1.5.0 the draw adapter uses, typed structurally
 * (as `mapbox-types.ts` types the global `mapboxgl`): `terra-draw-adapter.ts` takes these constructors from its lazy
 * loader (`loadTerraDraw`), its Node-free unit tests take a fake of them, and a browser test drives the real ones
 * (`packages/ui/test/map/draw/terra-draw-real.test.ts`). The names and shapes are the installed 1.x API
 * (`new TerraDraw({adapter, modes, idStrategy})`, `start`, `setMode`, `getSnapshot`, `addFeatures`,
 * `updateFeatureGeometry`, `removeFeatures`, `selectFeature`, `setModeStyles`, `getFeaturesAtLngLat`, the `change`,
 * `finish`, `select` and `deselect` events; modes with `styles` and `validation`, the select mode's per-mode `flags`,
 * `keyEvents` and `allowManualDeselection`), as read from the installed declarations (DECISIONS-for-review.md §34g). The
 * real constructors take wider options (Mapbox's own map type), so the loader hands them over as these types and the
 * browser test with the real Terra Draw is what proves the match.
