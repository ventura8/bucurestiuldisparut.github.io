/**
 * When `<hcm-timeline>` sends `hcm-year-change` (the owner, 2026-11-13): a key's year at once; during a press (a mouse's
 * drag, a finger's scrub) its first new year at once, then at most one per animation frame, the latest, so a fast scrub
 * selects live without queueing map work, and the press's end sends what is left. The store writes the hash with
 * `replaceState`, so the scrub leaves no history entry per year. The year sent is the one selected, kept here: the
 * viewer renders the timeline with the store's year meanwhile, one behind (lesson 648).
