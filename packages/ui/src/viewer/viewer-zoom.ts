 * buttons, not Mapbox's NavigationControl: the kit's 48 px targets, theme and languages (DECISIONS-for-review.md §128);
 * the group's head is our own compass (V64, `hcm-compass.ts`). A click asks the store for one level (`zoomBy`); at the city's zoom limit the button
 * is soft-disabled: it says so and keeps the focus. In swipe compare the second map follows the first, so one pair serves both.
 * Zoom out's limit is the higher of `city.minZoom` and the zoom at which the city's bounds just cover the map: Mapbox keeps
 * the view inside `maxBounds`, so on most screens it stops there first (Bucharest: about 10.8 on a phone, 11.6 at 1440 px).
