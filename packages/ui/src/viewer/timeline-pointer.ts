 * The pointers on `<hcm-timeline>`'s track. A mouse on a scrolling track pans it (a click selects, `timeline-pan.ts`). A

 * selecting until release; hovering shows the year chip on a stop without its own label (`timeline-tip.ts`). A finger
 * scrubs along the track, each year it enters selected at once, the chip naming it (`timeline-scrub.ts`); on a scrolling
 * track a finger elsewhere than on the thumb may scroll the card, so it selects only as a tap, the chip shown while down.
 * Selections during a press are live (`select`, coalesced by the timeline to one event per frame); its end `settle`s them,
 * and only a press the visitor lifted (not a cancelled one) may open the date menu of a year with several dates (V13).
