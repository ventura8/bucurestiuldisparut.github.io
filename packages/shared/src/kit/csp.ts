/**
 * The meta Content Security Policy of every static page that boots the engine (M5, `docs/research/M5-interfaces.md`
 * §3.2): a city site of this repository (`scripts/site`, which imports this table: CR-M5-6), the starter kit's page
 * (the engine from its pinned jsDelivr folder) and the static export's (the engine in `engine/` beside the page).
 * GitHub Pages and an export's static host cannot send headers, so the policy is a meta element, the page's first; one
 * table, so the sites, the kit and the export never drift (`docs/research/DECISIONS-for-review.md` §15c).
 *
 * Fixed sources: the page's own origin (the manifest and the photos served next to the page), Mapbox GL JS from
 * api.mapbox.com and the Mapbox APIs, the engine's own files (its script, stylesheet and fonts: the page's origin, or
 * the pinned folder of a release) and the Google Analytics and Firebase hosts the telemetry may load after the visitor
 * consents. A site adds the origins its manifest names (an https manifest, photo or tile host, the crash endpoint).
