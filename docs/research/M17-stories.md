# M17: stories

The owner's decision (2026-11-08): a new kind of content, the **story**. A story is a titled text in Romanian and English (more
languages later), linked to photos, places and years, read in the public map and edited in the admin with history and revert
like a photo or a place. Uploaders may write stories that wait in the review queue of M13 (`M13-roles.md`); moderators and staff
approve them. No HTML comes from data: the text is a small safe format our own templates render. The pictures inside a story are
the city's own photos only. The manifest gains an additive `stories` list, and the static export carries it.

This file is the contract, written before the code; §10 says what was built.

## 1. The document

`cities/{city}/stories/{story}` (`storyDocSchema`, `packages/shared/src/schemas/story.ts`):

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `{ro, en?}`, 1 to 200 | Required, never blank. |
| `body` | `{ro, en?}`, 1 to 10 000 | The story text (§3). Optional while a draft: a published story without it is refused by the editor and skipped by the builder. |
| `yearStart`, `yearEnd` | 1800 to 2100 | Either may be absent, never inverted (`validYearSpan`, as a place). |
| `photoIds` | ids, at most 20 | Photos the story is about; the first is its cover. |
| `poiIds` | ids, at most 20 | Places the story is about. |
| `published` | bool | |
| `reviewStatus`, `reviewNote`, `reviewedBy`, `reviewedAt`, `credit` | M13's `reviewFields` | Server-owned but for an uploader's `reviewStatus: 'pending'` on create. |
| `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, `updatedAt` | the stamp | As every client write. |

`CLIENT_WRITES.story`: `title`, `body`, `yearStart`, `yearEnd`, `photoIds`, `poiIds`, `credit`, `published` and the stamp; a create
adds `createdAt`, `createdBy` (and an uploader's `reviewStatus`).

## 2. Who may do what

The rules copy the place's (`firebase/firestore.rules`, `match /stories/{story}`), so M13's table holds with one more row:

| Action | stranger | uploader | moderator | editor | owner | other city's member |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stories` read | no | own only | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `stories` create | no | pending only, unpublished | no | yes | yes | no |
| `stories` update | no | own, while pending, never `published` | yes, `published` only through `review.decide` while pending | yes | yes | no |
| `stories` delete | no | own, pending or refused | no | yes | yes | no |
| `stories/*/history` read | no | no | yes | yes | yes | no |

- `review.decide` takes `entity: 'story'`: approve publishes it, refuse keeps it private; `seenAt` binds the approval to what the
  reviewer read, as for a place. A story without its text answers `apiError.review.storyEmpty` to an approval (the builder would
  list nothing, and the approved story would no longer be the uploader's to write); refusing it stays open.
- `history.revert` takes `entity: 'story'`, and a moderator may revert one (photo, place, story).
- The audit triggers `history.onStoryWrite` and the publish trigger `publish.onStoryWrite` join the families.

## 3. The text format

A story's body is the Markdown subset of the city's texts (`text/markdown.ts`): paragraphs separated by a blank line, a single
line break kept, `**bold**`, `_italic_` or `*italic*`, `[label](https://…)` links (https only: anything else stays literal text
and the schema refuses it, `validation.markdownLink`), `\` escaping. Stories add one block (`text/story.ts`, `parseStory`):

```text
![The National Theatre, 1937](photo:p-teatru)
```

A paragraph that is **exactly** an image of `photo:<id>` (an id of `ID_PATTERN`, a caption of at most 300 characters, possibly
empty) is a figure of that photo. Anything else that looks like an image (an https picture, a `photo:` inside a sentence, a
`javascript:` target) stays plain text, so no address outside the city's photos is ever loaded. Nothing in the format produces
HTML: the parser returns a tree (`paragraph` with inline nodes, or `figure` with a photo id and a caption), and the viewer walks
it with Lit templates (`renderStory`), as it does the About text.

The body's figures are not references the manifest checks: a photo unpublished later must not take a story down with it. The
viewer leaves out a figure whose photo the manifest does not list. `photoIds` and `poiIds` are checked (§4).

## 4. The manifest (additive)

`stories` is an optional list (at most `MAX_STORIES`, 1000), emitted only when not empty, so a manifest from before it stays valid
and every 1.x engine reads it (`docs/ENGINE_API.md`, *Additions before 1.0.0*; no release is tagged yet). An entry is `{id, title,
body, yearStart?, yearEnd?, photoIds?, poiIds?, credit?}`, the texts `{ro, en?}` (Romanian is the fallback, as a photo's).

- `manifestRuleIssues`: unique story ids; every `photoIds` entry a photo of `photos` or `unplaced`; every `poiIds` entry a place
  of `pois` (`validation.reference`).
- The builder lists published, review-cleared stories with a body, sorted by id, and drops from `photoIds` and `poiIds` what the
  manifest does not list (an unpublished photo leaves the story, never the story the manifest), as it does a place's photos.
- The static export keeps `stories`, and drops from each story's `photoIds` the photos it does not carry (the unplaced ones).

## 5. The public map

- **Where a story is found**: a Stories item in the map's menu (when the city has any) opens the list, newest year last; a
  photo's sheet and a place's sheet list the stories that name them; a story's own link is the hash `#story=<id>` (and
  `&story=<id>` after the view), which the Share button copies while a story is open.
- **The list** (`<hcm-story-list>`): the cover thumbnail (the first linked photo, else the first figure), the title and the years.
- **The story** (`<hcm-story-sheet>`): the title, the years, the body with its figures (the photo's thumbnail and the caption;
  a click opens that photo), the linked places and photos as buttons that open them, and the contributor's credit. On a phone
  it is the same bottom sheet as a photo's, resizable, with the text at the body size and a line length the sheet sets.
- **The timeline**: opening a story with a year moves the timeline to the stop nearest its first year, so the map shows the
  city as the story tells it; closing the story leaves the timeline where it is. A link that carries both `story=` and `layers=`
  (the visitor moved the timeline with the story open, then shared) opens the story with the link's own layers and their year.
- An unknown id in the hash shows `error.unknownStory` and opens nothing.

## 6. The admin

- `#/stories` lists the city's stories (title, years, Unpublished, Waiting for review) with New story; `#/stories/<id>` opens the
  editor: title and text in both languages, the years, the linked photos and places (chips, added from the city's photos and
  places by title), Published (staff), Save with the conflict banner, Discard, Delete with a confirmation, and Versions
  (`#/history/story/<id>`, where Revert restores a version).
- The editor follows the city role as the rules do: a moderator gets no New story and no Delete (the rules refuse both); an
  uploader deletes only their own waiting or refused story; Versions shows to staff only, since `#/history` is not a route of
  a moderator or an uploader (`LIMITED_ROUTES`). A moderator's revert of a story stays `history.revert` (S-A100-HAPPY-REVERT)
  until the history route opens to moderators for their entities.
- New story asks for the Romanian title and creates the document unpublished (pending for an uploader), then opens it.
- An uploader sees and edits only their own stories while they wait; a moderator sees all; the navigation shows Stories to both.
- The review queue lists waiting stories with the photos and places, and Approve or Refuse as for a place.
- The area is its own lazy chunk (`stories`, a measured row in `scripts/ci/check_bundle_budget.py`); its texts are a catalogue
  folder of their own (`packages/shared/src/i18n/admin-stories/`), merged into the admin's catalogues in the entry, which has room.

## 7. Threats and what stops them

| Threat | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Script or markup in a story | The format is parsed to a tree and rendered with Lit's text bindings; no `innerHTML`, no HTML parser |
| A picture from anywhere | Only `photo:<id>` figures exist; any other image syntax is text; the picture comes from the manifest's photo entry |
| A `javascript:` or `http:` link | Kept as text and refused by the schema (`validation.markdownLink`) |
| An uploader publishes their story | `published == false` on create, `published` not in their update list, `review.decide` is the door |
| An uploader swaps the text just before approval | `seenAt` (`apiError.review.changed`) |
| A moderator approves a story saved with its title only | `apiError.review.storyEmpty`; the story stays pending and the uploader's |
| A pending story reaches the public | The builder drops `pending` and `refused` whatever `published` says |
| A huge story | 10 000 characters per language in the schema and the rules; 1000 stories per manifest |

## 8. Scenarios

Viewer V50 (menu, list, story, figures, timeline, link; bad: an unknown id, markup stays text, a figure of a photo not listed, a
link's own layers kept over the story's year);
admin A100 (create, edit, publish, history and revert; bad: an http link refused, an uploader's story waits and cannot publish, a
story without text is not approved, a moderator gets no New story, Delete or Versions);
`functions` and `rules` rows for the builder, `review.decide`, `history.revert`, the export and the rules. The rows are in `e2e/scenarios.json`.

## 9. Left for later

- More languages than Romanian and English follow the catalogue work of the 16 languages.
- A story's own AI assists (translation drafts) and the Contribute page's "write a story" for strangers.

## 10. As built

Built on `track/stories` (2026-11-08), as designed above, with these details:

- **Code.** The format: `packages/shared/src/text/story.ts` (`parseStory`, `storyFigureIds`, `storyRejectedLinks`); the schemas:
  `packages/shared/src/schemas/story.ts` (`storySchema`, `MAX_STORIES`) and `storyDocSchema` in `firestore.ts`; the manifest rule
  `storyReferences` in `manifest-rules.ts`; the hash's `story=` in `url/hash.ts`. The functions: `storyEntry` in
  `functions/src/publish/assemble.ts`, `exportedStories` in `functions/src/export/plan.ts`, `decideText` in
  `functions/src/photos/review-decide.ts` (a place and a story alike), `REVIEWED_ENTITIES` in `functions/src/history/revert.ts`.
  The rules: `validStory` and `match /stories/{story}`. The viewer: `withStory` in `packages/engine/src/core/state.ts`, `openStory`
  in the store, `<hcm-stories>` (`packages/ui/src/viewer/hcm-stories.ts`) in the sheet of `viewer-stories.ts`, `relatedStories` in
  the photo's and the place's sheet, the menu's Stories (icon `museum`, already in the icon font). The admin: `packages/admin/src/stories/`
  (the store on `EditDraft`, `LiveDoc`, `LiveList` and `readOnce`, all already in `editor-shared`), `<hcm-stories-page>`
  (`packages/ui/src/admin/stories/`), the route `stories` after Places (an uploader's and a moderator's navigation include it), and
  the review queue's third list (`storyItem` in `packages/admin/src/review/rows.ts`).
- **The editor.** New story takes a Romanian title and creates the document at once, unpublished (pending for an uploader): the
  editor then works on a stored document as the layer editor does, with Save of the changed fields, the conflict banner, Discard and
  Delete after a confirmation. A published story without a text is refused at the text (`storyIssues`). The pickers read the city's
  photos and places once (an uploader's own only, which is what the rules let them read).
- **An uploader's New story.** The admin's create is a transaction that reads the id first, and the place's read rule denies a
  document that does not exist; the stories rule lets an uploader read an id with no document (`resource == null`), which says
  nothing (`docs/LESSONS.md` 445; the same gap likely stands for an uploader's own place or photo created in the admin).
- **Notifications.** `review.waiting` comes for free: `history.onStoryWrite` runs the same `tellReviewers` as every audited entity.
- **Budgets** (measured on the NUC, gzip level 9): the `stories` chunk 4.4 KB after the review of 2026-11-08 (row 5 KB, new), `review` 5.0 of 5, the admin's total
  647.9 of 650, the entry 379.2 of 450, `engine.mjs` 96.3 of 100, `engine.iife.js` 124.0 of 125. No row rose. `editor-shared` reached
  13,001 bytes of 13,000 once the new area imported the kit it shares; `packages/ui/src/viewer/markdown.ts` moved to the
  `editor-texts` group (`packages/admin/vite.config.ts`), which brings it to 12.8 (DECISIONS §102).
- **Left for later.** A story's AI translation draft; a picker for figures (the text names a photo by its id, which the photo's
  address in the admin shows); more languages; the Contribute page's "write a story" for someone without a role.

## 11. At the merge with the improvements (2026-11-08)

Home's *What needs you* (M18 item 7) lists the stories waiting in the review queue, *Stories to review*, a link to `#/review`; an uploader is not asked that count (S-A40-HAPPY-STORIES-TO-REVIEW, S-A40-BAD-UPLOADER-NO-STORY-COUNT; DECISIONS §104c).
