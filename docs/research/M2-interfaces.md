# M2 interfaces: the backend contracts the parallel agents build on

Written on 2026-10-12 by the M2 contracts agent, alone in the tree, before the M2 backend workstreams start in
parallel. Read it together with `PLAN.md` (Addenda 1–3), `design-review-security-cost.md` (IAM §1.1, secrets §1.2,
public tokens §1.3, rules §1.4–§1.5, reliability §4), `design-review-onboarding.md` (the wizards of §2),
`M1-interfaces.md` (the viewer contracts and CR-1 to CR-21), `M0-handoff.md` (toolchain, gates, workspaces) and
`docs/ENGINE_API.md` (the public manifest).

Everything marked **done** exists and is tested (100 % lines and branches per file); everything else is a contract the
owning workstream implements exactly as written. A change to anything here goes through
[Change requests](#change-requests), never by editing another workstream's files. Nothing in M2 touches a real Google,
Mapbox or USGS endpoint: every test runs against the Firebase emulators (project `demo-hcm`) and local fakes.

## 1. Module ownership

| Workstream | Owns (writes) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contracts (**done**) | `packages/shared/src/{schemas,api,i18n/api,text/redact.ts}/**` (the M2 parts), `functions/src/ports/**`, `functions/src/api/**`, this file | After the parallel build starts, these change only through a change request. Exception: a workstream that first imports a port's secondary type (`AuthUser`, `QueryOptions`, `DocumentTransaction`, ...) adds `export` to it (they stay file-local until someone imports them, or knip reports them) and says so in its report. |
| rules | `firebase/firestore.rules`, `firebase/storage.rules`, `firebase/firestore.indexes.json`, `firebase/rules-tests/**` | Mirrors `CLIENT_WRITES` and the paths of §2 (CR-M2-1). |
| fn-admin | `functions/src/{admin,history,telemetry}/**`, `functions/src/adapters/{documents,auth-admin,error-reporting}.ts`, their tests under `functions/test/{admin,history,telemetry,adapters}/**` | `admin.*`, `admins.*`, `history.*`, `telemetry.*`; the Firestore, Auth and Error Reporting adapters. |
| fn-setup | `functions/src/setup/**`, `functions/src/adapters/{secret-manager,mapbox,usgs,firebase-management,resource-manager}.ts`, tests under `functions/test/{setup,adapters}/**` | `setup.*`; the Secret Manager adapter replaces `adapters/secret-store-rest.ts` (rename, same behaviour); moves `setup-status` from the M0 `triggers/` and `handlers/` folders into `setup/` and deletes those folders and `triggers/admin-guard.ts` (superseded by `functions/src/api/access.ts`). |
| fn-content | `functions/src/{photos,publish,ops}/**`, `functions/src/adapters/{storage,cloud-tasks,image}.ts`, tests under `functions/test/{photos,publish,ops,adapters}/**` | `photos.*`, `publish.*`, `ops.*`. |
| fakes | `packages/test-support/src/{api-fixtures,fakes}/**` (with their `package.json` exports), `functions/test/support/**` | The upstream fixtures and fakes every tier shares (§7), and the in-memory port fakes the three function workstreams use. |
| integrator | `functions/src/index.ts`, `functions/src/global-options.ts`, `functions/src/deps.ts`, `functions/package.json`, `firebase.json`, `docs/*.md`, `.agent/**`, `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`, `e2e/scenarios.json` after this task | Wires the registry (§3) into exports, picks the adapters, resolves the change requests. |

Adapters a workstream writes are its own, even when another workstream's handler uses them; a missing adapter method is
a change request to its owner. Ask-first files (`AGENTS.md` → *Boundaries*) stay ask-first: the proposals of this
milestone are `DECISIONS-for-review.md` §19.

Tests live under `functions/test/<folder>/**` mirroring `functions/src/<folder>/**`, and name their scenarios (§6) with
the tag `@S-…` anywhere in the file, usually in the test title (the `e2e-matrix` gate reads `functions/test/` and
`firebase/rules-tests/`; a `Scenarios:` line is matched only at the start of a line, as Python docstrings write it).

## 2. Firestore model (done)

`@hcm/shared` holds every document schema; every server writer validates with it before writing (the Admin SDK
bypasses the rules) and every reader validates what it reads.

| File | Exports |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/shared/src/schemas/firestore-common.ts` | `timestampSchema`, `TimestampLike`, `timestampFromDate`, `timestampToDate`, `uidSchema`, `sha256Schema`, `SYSTEM_WRITERS`, `systemWriter`, the audit `stamp` |
| `packages/shared/src/schemas/firestore.ts` | content: `cityDocSchema`, `photoDocSchema`, `layerDocSchema`, `poiDocSchema`, `poiCategoryDocSchema`, `historyEntryDocSchema`; `FIRESTORE_LICENSES`, `PROCESSING_STATES`, `LAYER_STATUSES`, `USGS_DATASETS`, `GEOREF_METHODS`, `HISTORY_ENTITIES`, `HISTORY_ACTIONS`, `PHOTO_CONTENT_TYPES`, `mapboxTokenIdSchema`, `httpsOriginSchema` |
| `packages/shared/src/schemas/firestore-ops.ts` | operations: `jobDocSchema`, `jobLogDocSchema`, `usgsSceneDocSchema`, `setupStatusDocSchema`, `ownerDocSchema`, `adminDocSchema`, `inviteDocSchema`, `usageDocSchema`, `opsGuardDocSchema`, `manifestStateDocSchema`; `JOB_*`, `USGS_SCENE_STATUSES`, `SERVICE_STATES`, `SETUP_AREAS`, `PROVISION_ITEMS`, `USGS_ROLES`, `ADMIN_ROLES`, `GUARD_*`, `OPS_STEPS`, `MANIFEST_BUILD_STATES`, `MANIFEST_ENTITIES` |
| `packages/shared/src/schemas/client-writes.ts` | `CLIENT_WRITES`: per collection, the fields a client create may contain and an update may change |
| `packages/shared/src/schemas/paths.ts` | `FIRESTORE_PATHS`, `STORAGE_PATHS`, `auditedDocumentPath`, `parseAuditedDocumentPath`, `parsePhotoUploadPath`, `publicObjectUrl`, `CITY_ID_PATTERN`, `cityIdSchema`, `UPLOAD_FILE_PATTERN`, `PHOTO_EXTENSIONS`, `PHOTO_VARIANTS` |

### 2.1 Documents

| Path | Schema | Written by | Client (rules) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cities/{city}` | `cityDocSchema` | admins (settings), `setup.saveMapbox` / `rotatePublicToken` (`mapbox`), `setup.analyticsConfig` (`analytics`) | read, update `CLIENT_WRITES.city.update` |
| `cities/{city}/photos/{photo}` | `photoDocSchema` | admins; `photos.onUpload` (`image`, `exif`, `processing`, `processingError`, `duplicateOf`, `suggested`, `original`) | read, create, update, delete |
| `cities/{city}/layers/{layer}` | `layerDocSchema` | the pipeline (M3); admins (presentation, opacity, `adjustments`) | read, update |
| `cities/{city}/pois/{poi}` | `poiDocSchema` | admins | read, create, update, delete |
| `cities/{city}/poiCategories/{category}` | `poiCategoryDocSchema` | admins | read, create, update, delete |
| `<audited document>/history/{entry}` | `historyEntryDocSchema` | `history.on*Write`, `history.revert` | read only |
| `cities/{city}/jobs/{job}` (+ `logs/{line}`) | `jobDocSchema`, `jobLogDocSchema` | admins create `queued`; the dispatcher and the pipeline (M3) | read; create; update `cancelRequested` |
| `cities/{city}/usgsScenes/{entity}` | `usgsSceneDocSchema` | the harvest (M3); admins triage | read; update `status`, `note` |
| `setup/status` | `setupStatusDocSchema` | `setup.*`, `ops.tick` | read only |
| `setup/owner` | `ownerDocSchema` | `admin.claim` (created once) | read only |
| `admins/{uid}` | `adminDocSchema` | `admin.claim`, `admin.join`, `admins.revoke`, the bootstrap script | read (own or admin) |
| `invites/{sha256}` | `inviteDocSchema` | `admins.invite`; deleted by `admin.join`, `admins.revoke`, `ops.tick` | read only |
| `usage/mapbox-YYYY-MM` | `usageDocSchema` | the publisher (M3) | read only |
| `ops/guard` | `opsGuardDocSchema` | `ops.tick`, `ops.onBudget` | read only |
| `manifests/{city}` | `manifestStateDocSchema` | `publish.*` | read only |

`setup/status` holds one record per Setup Assistant area (`SETUP_AREAS`: billing, provision, mapbox, usgs, analytics,
crash), each `{state, checkedAt?, detail?, params?}` plus its area's non-secret fields; `state` is one of
`SERVICE_STATES` (`missing`, `pending` = waiting for someone outside such as the USGS approval, `ok`, `invalid`,
`unavailable` = the service did not answer); `detail` is an error code (§3.0) with its `params`, never free text.

### 2.2 Audit stamp and history

- **Every** document carries `updatedBy` and `updatedAt`. A client write stamps its uid and `serverTimestamp()` (the
  rules check both); a callable stamps the calling admin's uid; a trigger or the scheduler stamps
  `systemWriter('<family>')` (`system:history`, `system:photos`, `system:publish`, `system:ops`, `system:setup`,
  `system:pipeline`, ...). Handlers write times with `timestampFromDate(clock.now())`.
- **History** (PLAN Addendum 3): the triggers `history.on{City,Layer,Photo,Poi,PoiCategory}Write`
  (`onDocumentWrittenWithAuthContext`, so a delete knows who deleted) write one entry per change into the document's
  `history` subcollection, id `historyEntryId(eventTime, event.id)` (sorts by time; a redelivered event writes the same
  entry). `previous` is the whole document before the change (none for a create), `changedFields` the top-level keys
  whose values differ, the stamp the change's own (a delete: `event.authId`, else `system:<authType>`, at the event's time but never before the version it deleted, `docs/LESSONS.md` 121). After writing,
  the trigger deletes the oldest entries beyond `HISTORY_KEEP` (50).
- `history.revert` writes the restored document **and** its own `revert` entry (`revertOf` = the restored entry,
  `previous` = the version it replaced, null when it restores a deleted document) in one transaction; the trigger
  skips a change whose newest entry is a `revert` with the same `updatedAt`.

### 2.3 Client writes: CR-1 and CR-4 resolved

`CLIENT_WRITES` (`client-writes.ts`) is the contract the rules mirror; `packages/shared/test/schemas/client-writes.test.ts`
pins that every listed field belongs to its schema, every write carries the stamp, and no server-owned field is
listed. What the rules must change (CR-M2-1, owner: rules):

- **CR-1**: photos accept `dateText` (`{ro, en?}`, ≤ 100) and require `title.ro` (`localizedPartial`: Romanian
  required, English optional), for create and update.
- **CR-4**: `pois/{poi}` and `poiCategories/{category}`: admin create, update and delete with exactly the fields of
  `CLIENT_WRITES.poi` / `.poiCategory` (geometry `{type:'Point', point}`, `{type:'LineString', points}` or
  `{type:'Polygon', rings:[{points}]}` with at most 500 vertices and 20 rings, `category` an id, `photoIds` ≤ 20,
  `links` ≤ 5, icon `^[a-z0-9_]{1,64}$`, colour `#rrggbb`, `defaultOpacity` 0–1); `history/{entry}` under every audited
  document (`cities/{city}/history/{entry}` and `cities/{city}/{collection}/{id}/history/{entry}` for `layers`,
  `photos`, `pois`, `poiCategories`): admin read, never written by a client;
  `layers`: admins may also change `adjustments` (the four `LAYER_ADJUSTMENT_RANGES`, `brightnessMin ≤
  brightnessMax`), `year`, `date`; `cities/{city}`: `photosOverlay.defaultOpacity` 0–1, and `analytics` and `engine`
  join `id`, `mapbox`, `createdAt` as server-owned.
- **Stamps everywhere**: job creates carry `updatedBy`/`updatedAt` too (`CLIENT_WRITES.job`), so does the
  cancellation and every `usgsScenes` triage update.
- **Server-owned photo fields** join the photo key list: `processingError`, `duplicateOf`, `suggested`, `original`
  (never client-writable, like `image`, `exif`, `processing`).
- **New read-only collections** for admins: `invites/{id}`, `manifests/{city}`, `setup/owner` (inside `setup/{doc}`).

### 2.4 Paths and buckets

`FIRESTORE_PATHS` and `STORAGE_PATHS` spell every path; builders throw a `RangeError` on an id that could leave its
segment. City ids are lowercase (`CITY_ID_PATTERN` = `^[a-z0-9-]{2,32}$`, what `storage.rules` already matches; the
manifest's `city.id` keeps the wider `ID_PATTERN`).

| Object | Bucket | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| photo upload (client) | private | `uploads/photos/{city}/{uid}/{photo}/{nonce}.{ext}`; `{photo}` is the photo document created just before; the original file name travels as the custom metadata `originalName` |
| photo original | private | `originals/photos/{city}/{photo}/{sha256}.{ext}` |
| photo derivatives | public | `photos/{city}/{photo}/{sha8}/{web,thumb}.webp`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| manifest | public | `cities/{city}/manifest.json`, gzip, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60` |

Public URLs are `publicObjectUrl(bucket, path)` = `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket>/<path>`.

## 3. API contracts (`packages/shared/src/api/**`, done)

`CALLABLES`, `HTTP_ENDPOINTS` and `BACKGROUND_FUNCTIONS` (`packages/shared/src/api/registry.ts`) list every function with
its owner. The functions validate requests and responses against these schemas; the admin calls
`httpsCallable(functions, deployedName(name))` (`admin.claim` deploys as `admin-claim`) and validates the answer.

### 3.0 Conventions

- **Plumbing (done)**: `defineCallable(name, handler, getDeps)` (`functions/src/api/callable.ts`) builds every
  callable: options from the registry (`maxInstances`; App Check from `HCM_APP_CHECK`: `monitor` until the admin ships
  reCAPTCHA Enterprise and a week passes, then `enforce`, with `consumeAppCheckToken` for `consume` callables), the
  access rule (`requireAccess`, `functions/src/api/access.ts`: `signedIn` = verified Google account; `admin` = also
  the claim and `admins/{uid}`), request validation (`apiError.invalidRequest` with the field issues), the pure handler
  `(deps, caller, data) => Promise<response>`, response validation (a mismatch is logged and answered
  `apiError.internal`). Handlers throw `ApiError(code, params?)` (`functions/src/api/api-error.ts`); `toHttpsError`
  turns it into `HttpsError(API_ERRORS[code].status, code, details)`.
- **Error codes** are i18n keys: `packages/shared/src/i18n/api/{ro,en}.ts` (the backend's own catalogue, kept out of the
  viewer bundle; the `i18n` gate checks it), mapped to their callable status, HTTP status and retryability by
  `API_ERRORS`. `details` = `{code, params?, issues?}` (`apiErrorDetailsSchema`); the admin shows
  `translateApiError(locale, code, params)` and reads a failure with `apiErrorFromFailure(error.code, error.details)`.
- **Upstream failures**: adapters throw `UpstreamError(service, failure)` (§4.1). A handler maps the failures it
  expects to its specific codes; anything it does not map falls back (`rateLimited` → `apiError.rateLimited`,
  `maintenance`/`unavailable` → `apiError.unavailable`, `conflict` → `apiError.conflict`, `notFound` →
  `apiError.notFound`, the rest → `apiError.internal`, logged).
- **Secrets** never appear in a response, a document, a log line or an error: the logger redacts secret-looking keys,
  `redactText` (`packages/shared/src/text/redact.ts`) strips tokens, keys, addresses and URL queries from free text.
- **Times** travel as ISO 8601 strings (`isoTimeSchema`), are stored as timestamps.

### 3.1 `admin.*` and `admins.*` (fn-admin; A01, A02, A20)

| Callable | Access | Request → response | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admin.session` | signedIn | `{}` → `{admin, role, claim, refreshToken, ownerClaimed, invitePending}` | |
| `admin.claim` | signedIn, consume | `{googleAccessToken}` → `{role:'owner', refreshToken:true}` | `claim.tokenInvalid`, `claim.tokenMismatch`, `claim.scopeMissing`, `claim.notOwner`, `claim.alreadyClaimed` |
| `admin.join` | signedIn, consume | `{}` → `{role, refreshToken:true}` | `invite.notFound`, `invite.expired` |
| `admins.invite` | admin | `{email}` → `{inviteId, expiresAt, signInUrl}` | `invite.alreadyAdmin` |
| `admins.revoke` | admin | `{kind:'admin', uid}` or `{kind:'invite', inviteId}` → `{revoked:true}` | `revoke.owner`, `revoke.self`, `notFound` |
| `admins.list` | admin | `{}` → `{admins[], invites[]}` | |

**Owner claim, no e-mail address anywhere** (`admin.claim`):

1. The admin app asks Google for `CLAIM_OAUTH_SCOPE` (`cloud-platform.read-only`, incremental consent) and sends the
   access token it got.
2. `iam.tokenInfo(token)`: an invalid or expired token → `apiError.claim.tokenInvalid`. Its `email` must equal the
   caller's verified ID-token address (case-insensitive) and its `audience` must be one of `config.oauthClientIds`,
   else `apiError.claim.tokenMismatch`; its scopes must include `CLAIM_OAUTH_SCOPE` or `cloud-platform`, else
   `apiError.claim.scopeMissing`.
3. `iam.testProjectPermissions(config.projectId, token, [OWNER_PERMISSION])` with **the caller's** token must grant
   `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy`, else `apiError.claim.notOwner` with `{projectId}`.
4. A transaction creates `setup/owner` `{uid, claimedAt}`; when it exists for another uid →
   `apiError.claim.alreadyClaimed` (the same uid again is an idempotent success). It writes `admins/{uid}` (`role:
   owner`, the verified address and name from the ID token, the stamp).
5. `auth.setAdminClaim(uid, true)`; the response tells the app to refresh its ID token. The access token is used for
   these two calls only, never stored, never logged.

**Invitations**: `admins.invite` stores `invites/{inviteIdFor(email)}` (SHA-256 of the trimmed, lowercase address;
`role: 'admin'`, `invitedBy`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt` = now + `INVITE_TTL_DAYS`) and answers the admin's address; no
mail is sent in M2 (the inviter shares the link; an e-mail-link invitation is a later option). A re-invitation resets
the expiry; an address that already belongs to an admin → `apiError.invite.alreadyAdmin`. `admin.join` hashes the
caller's verified address, checks the invitation (missing → `invite.notFound`, expired → `invite.expired`), then in one
transaction creates `admins/{uid}` and deletes the invitation, then sets the claim. `admin.session` reports a pending
invitation, whether the map has an owner, and `refreshToken` when the document and the claim disagree.

**Revocation**: never the owner (`revoke.owner`), never oneself (`revoke.self`), so a map always keeps an admin. It
deletes `admins/{uid}`, removes the claim and revokes the refresh tokens; the access rule and the security rules deny
the next call at once because they also require the document (S-A20-BAD-ADMIN-REMOVED).

### 3.2 `history.*` (fn-admin; A23)

| Callable | Access | Request → response | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `history.revert` | admin | `{cityId, entity, entityId, entryId}` → `{restoredFields}` | `history.notFound`, `history.nothingToRestore`, `history.invalidSnapshot` (`{count}`) |

Admins read history with the Firestore SDK (`FIRESTORE_PATHS.history(document)`, ordered by id). A revert restores
the client-editable fields (`CLIENT_WRITES[entity].update`) from `previous`, keeps the current value of every
server-owned field (a revert never resurrects a rotated token or a replaced image; a deleted document comes back with
its snapshot's), stamps the caller, and validates the result with the entity's schema first: a snapshot that today's
schema refuses is not written (`invalidSnapshot` with the number of issues). The entry of a create has nothing to
restore.

### 3.3 `setup.*` (fn-setup; A03–A07, A22)

| Callable | Access | Request → response | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `setup.status` | admin | `{}` → `SetupStatusView` | |
| `setup.selfTest` | admin | `{}` → `{checks[], status}` | per check, in `checks[].detail` |
| `setup.recordCloud` | admin | `{billing?, provision?}` → `{status}` | |
| `setup.saveMapbox` | admin, consume | `{cityId, secretToken}` → `{mapbox, viewer:{tokenId, allowedUrls}, admin:{…}}` | `mapbox.publicToken`, `mapbox.tokenFormat`, `mapbox.tokenInvalid`, `mapbox.missingScopes` (`{scopes}`), `mapbox.mintRefused`, `mapbox.unavailable`, `secrets.unavailable` |
| `setup.saveUsgs` | admin, consume | `{username, applicationToken, expiresOn?}` → `{usgs}` | `usgs.credentials`, `usgs.maintenance`, `usgs.unavailable`, `rateLimited`, `secrets.unavailable` |
| `setup.rotatePublicToken` | admin, consume | `{cityId, audience}` → `{tokenId, retiresOldAt, manifestQueued}` | `mapbox.notConfigured`, `mapbox.mintRefused` |
| `setup.analyticsConfig` | admin | `{cityId}` → `{analytics, measurementId, firebase, manifestQueued}` | `analytics.noWebApp`, `analytics.notEnabled`, `cloud.permission` (`{role}`), `cloud.apiDisabled` (`{api}`) |

- **`setup.status`** reads `setup/status` leniently (the `SetupRecords` port: field by field, an unknown or malformed
  field falls back to its default and never leaves the function) and answers `setupStatusViewSchema`; `ready` is
  `setupReady(view)`: billing, provision, Mapbox and USGS `ok`.
- **`setup.saveMapbox`** (onboarding §2B, security review §1.3): `classifyMapboxToken` refuses a `pk.` or anything
  that is not an `sk.` before any call; `mapbox.retrieveToken` (must be `TokenValid`, `usage: 'sk'`; the `user` is the
  username, never typed); `mapbox.listTokens(user)` finds the token by id and `missingScopes(scopes)` must be empty
  (`MAPBOX_BOOTSTRAP_SCOPES`); then `mapbox-sk-bootstrap` goes to Secret Manager; the tiles token
  (`MAPBOX_TILES_SCOPES`) is minted once into `mapbox-sk-tiles` (kept while its id still exists); the viewer token
  (`MAPBOX_PUBLIC_SCOPES`, `allowedUrls` = `config.viewerOrigins`) and the admin token (`config.adminOrigins`) are
  updated in place when their ids still exist, else created; the viewer token goes to `cities/{city}.mapbox`, the admin
  token to `setup/status.mapbox`; `secretsRev` is bumped. A second save adds no token (S-A06-BAD-SAVED-TWICE). Mapbox
  refusing to create a token (a demo account, billing not confirmed) is `mapbox.mintRefused`.
- **`setup.saveUsgs`** (onboarding §2C): `usgs.login` → `usgs.permissions` → `usgs.logout` (always); both values go to
  Secret Manager; `usgs` becomes `ok` with the `download` role, else `pending` with `nextCheckAt` = now +
  `USGS_RECHECK_HOURS`; `expiresOn` becomes `tokenExpiresAt` (the card reminds `USGS_EXPIRY_REMINDER_DAYS` before).
- **`setup.selfTest`** runs `SELF_TEST_CHECKS` in order with the runtime service account, each isolated: a Firestore
  read, the Secret Manager reads, a write and delete in each bucket (`tmp/selftest`), a manifest rebuild enqueued for
  each city (harmless), Mapbox `retrieveToken` with the stored token, a USGS login and logout, Firebase Management
  `listWebApps`, Error Reporting `listGroups(24 h, 1)`; it updates the Mapbox, USGS and crash records.
- **`setup.recordCloud`**: the browser-side Google Cloud steps (PLAN Addendum 1: billing via `cloudbilling`, the $5
  budget via `billingbudgets`, Provision cloud with the admin's own token) report what they found; the server stamps the
  caller and stores it; `provision.state` is the worst item state (`invalid` > `unavailable` > `missing` > `pending` >
  `ok`).
- **`setup.rotatePublicToken`**: mints a new public token with the same origins, writes it (the city document for the
  viewer, which triggers a manifest rebuild), and queues the old id in `setup/status.mapbox.retiring` with `retireAt`
  = now + `TOKEN_RETIRE_MINUTES`; `ops.tick` deletes it then.
- **`setup.analyticsConfig`**: `firebase.listWebApps` (an `ACTIVE` app, else `analytics.noWebApp`) →
  `webAppConfig`; without `measurementId` → `analytics.notEnabled` (the card's deep link enables Google Analytics);
  writes `cities/{city}.analytics` `{measurementId, firebase: {apiKey, appId, projectId}}` (public identifiers, never
  committed: CR-9 of M1) and `setup/status.analytics`. The manifest builder adds `analytics.errorEndpoint` =
  `config.errorEndpoint` to every manifest, so crash reports work before analytics is set up.

### 3.4 `telemetry.*` (fn-admin; V20, A22, A24)

`telemetry.reportError` is the one public HTTPS function (`onRequest`, `maxInstances` 2), URL
`https://us-central1-<project>.cloudfunctions.net/telemetry-reportError` (`config.errorEndpoint`). In order:

1. `OPTIONS` from an allowed origin → 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>`, `-Methods: POST`,
   `-Headers: content-type`, `-Max-Age: 3600`; any method but `POST` → 405.
2. `Origin` must be one of `config.viewerOrigins` or `config.adminOrigins`, else 403 `apiError.telemetry.origin`
   (no CORS header); the origin decides the service (`viewer` or `admin`).
3. A body over `ERROR_REPORT_MAX_BYTES` (16 KiB) → 413 `apiError.telemetry.tooLarge`, before parsing.
4. Rate limits per instance (`ERROR_REPORT_LIMITS`: 10 per client per minute, 120 per instance; the client is a
   salted hash of the IP held in memory only) → 429 `apiError.rateLimited` with `Retry-After: 60`.
5. The body is JSON whether sent as `text/plain` (the engine, no preflight) or `application/json`; invalid JSON or
   anything `errorReportSchema` refuses → 400 `apiError.invalidRequest` with the issues.
6. `redactText` again on message, stack and page; one `ErrorReporter.report(event)`: a structured log entry, severity
   ERROR, `jsonPayload` = `reportedErrorEventSchema` (`@type` ReportedErrorEvent, `message` = the stack or the message,
   `serviceContext {service, version: release}`, `context.httpRequest.url` = the page, `context.reportLocation`
   always set so Error Reporting groups non-V8 stacks too, `hcm` = the rest). No Firestore write per report.
7. 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>`. Error responses carry the JSON `apiErrorDetails`.

| Callable | Access | Request → response | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `telemetry.listGroups` | admin | `{hours: 24 \| 168 \| 720, pageSize, pageToken?}` → `{groups[], nextPageToken?}` | `errorReporting.unavailable`, `cloud.permission` (`roles/errorreporting.viewer`) |

### 3.5 `publish.*` (fn-content; A10, A19)

- **Triggers** `publish.on{City,Layer,Photo,Poi,PoiCategory}Write`: a write requests a build when `published`
  changes, or when the document is published (before or after) and a field the manifest carries changed (the builder's
  own field map, `functions/src/publish/`). A request is a transaction on `manifests/{city}` (`requestedVersion` + 1,
  `status: 'queued'`) plus `tasks.enqueue('publish-buildManifest', {cityId, requestedVersion, full: false}, {id:
  manifestTaskId(city, now), delaySeconds: MANIFEST_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS})`: writes within one minute share a build.
- **`publish.rebuildManifest`** (admin): `{cityId, full?}` → `{requestedVersion, queued}` (`queued: false` when this
  window's build was already queued).
- **`publish.buildManifest`** (task queue, `maxConcurrentDispatches: 1`, so builds never race): reads the city and
  every published layer, photo (only `processing: 'done'` with an `image`), POI and category; maps each to its manifest
  shape (`geometryFromDoc`, `{lat, lng}` → `[lng, lat]`, boxes to `[[w, s], [e, n]]`); a document that fails its
  manifest schema is skipped and listed in `manifests/{city}.skipped` (entity, id, first issue), never fails the build;
  the whole manifest passes `validateManifest`; uploads gzip to `STORAGE_PATHS.manifest` with `MANIFEST_CACHE_CONTROL`;
  records `builtVersion` (the version it started from), `builtAt`, `url`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `counts`. When
  `requestedVersion` moved on meanwhile, it queues the next build. M2 always builds in full (a city has about a hundred
  documents); the incremental build of security review §4.5 waits for a city past 500 documents.

### 3.6 `photos.*` (fn-content; A08–A10)

1. The admin creates `cities/{city}/photos/{photo}` (`processing: 'pending'`, `published: false`, the sticky author,
   source and licence, the last pin as `location`), then uploads the file to `STORAGE_PATHS.photoUpload(city, uid,
   photo, '<nonce>.<ext>')` with `customMetadata.originalName`.
2. **`photos.onUpload`** (Storage finalize on the private bucket, 2 GiB, concurrency 1, `maxInstances` 5):
   `parsePhotoUploadPath` (anything else is ignored); the photo document must exist (else the upload is deleted);
   `images.inspect` sniffs the bytes: not an accepted type → `processing: 'failed'`, `processingError:
   apiError.photo.unsupportedType`; over `PHOTO_LIMITS.maxInputPixels` → `apiError.photo.tooLarge` (`{megapixels:
   '200'}`); unreadable → `apiError.photo.unreadable`; the SHA-256 of an existing photo's original →
   `apiError.photo.duplicate` with `duplicateOf`. Otherwise: the original is copied to `STORAGE_PATHS.photoOriginal`,
   the WebP derivatives (2048 px and 400 px, metadata stripped, EXIF orientation applied) are written create-only to the
   public bucket, and the document gets `image`, `exif` (plain values), `suggested` (EXIF GPS and direction; year and
   title from `originalName` with the migration's `yearIn`; an EXIF date later than the file-name year is ignored),
   `original`, `processing: 'done'`, stamped `system:photos`; the upload is deleted.
3. **Replacing the image** is a new upload into the same photo folder; the old derivatives are deleted by `ops.tick`
   once no manifest names them. **`photos.reprocess`** (admin) copies the original back into a new upload, which runs
   step 2 again.

### 3.7 `ops.*` (fn-content)

`ops.tick` (`OPS_TICK_SCHEDULE`, every 15 minutes; one Scheduler job) runs `OPS_STEPS` in order, each isolated (a
failure is recorded in `ops/guard.lastTick.steps` and the next step runs): `guard` (create `ops/guard` green when
missing), `jobs` and `mts` (M3; report ok), `manifests` (the nightly full rebuild after `NIGHTLY_HOUR_UTC`, once per
day; delete public objects no manifest names, older than `UNPUBLISH_DELETE_MINUTES`), `health` (daily: Mapbox
`retrieveToken` and a USGS login; a `pending` USGS role whose `nextCheckAt` passed is checked again and turns `ok` on
approval), `tokens` (delete `setup/status.mapbox.retiring` tokens past `retireAt`), `invites` (delete expired
invitations), `users` (delete Auth accounts without an `admins/{uid}` document created more than `STALE_USER_HOURS`
ago; never the owner). `ops.onBudget` (Pub/Sub topic `budget`) turns `ops/guard` red when the cost reaches the budget;
it never touches the public site; turning it green again is an admin action of M3 (nothing consumes the guard before
the raster pipeline).

## 4. Ports (`functions/src/ports/**`, done)

| Port | File | What | Adapter (owner) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DocumentStore` | `documents.ts` | Firestore: `get`, `create`, `set`, `delete`, `query` (valid documents and the invalid ones apart), `transaction`; every read and write validated with a shared schema | `adapters/documents.ts` (fn-admin) |
| `AuthAdmin` | `auth-admin.ts` | `getUser`, `setAdminClaim`, `revokeSessions`, `deleteUser`, `listUsers` | `adapters/auth-admin.ts` (fn-admin) |
| `SecretStore` | `secret-store.ts` | M0: `read`, `write` (adds a version and destroys older ones), `invalidate`; 5-minute cache busted by `secretsRev` | `adapters/secret-manager.ts` (fn-setup) |
| `GoogleIam` | `google-iam.ts` | `tokenInfo(accessToken)`, `testProjectPermissions(projectId, accessToken, permissions)`, with the caller's token | `adapters/resource-manager.ts` (fn-setup) |
| `FirebaseManagement` | `firebase-management.ts` | `listWebApps`, `webAppConfig` | `adapters/firebase-management.ts` (fn-setup) |
| `ErrorReporter` | `error-reporter.ts` | `report(event)` (structured log), `listGroups(request)` (REST) | `adapters/error-reporting.ts` (fn-admin) |
| `TaskQueue` | `task-queue.ts` | `enqueue(queue, payload, {id, delaySeconds})` → false when the id exists | `adapters/cloud-tasks.ts` (fn-content) |
| `BlobStore` | `blob-store.ts` | `stat`, `read`, `write` (create-only with `ifGenerationMatch: 0`), `copy`, `delete`, `list` by bucket role | `adapters/storage.ts` (fn-content) |
| `ImageProcessor` | `image-processor.ts` | `inspect(bytes)` (magic bytes, size, EXIF), `webp(bytes, {longEdge, quality})` | `adapters/image.ts` (fn-content) |
| `MapboxApi` | `mapbox-api.ts` | `retrieveToken`, `listTokens`, `createToken`, `updateToken`, `deleteToken` | `adapters/mapbox.ts` (fn-setup) |
| `UsgsApi` | `usgs-api.ts` | `login`, `permissions`, `logout` | `adapters/usgs.ts` (fn-setup) |
| `Clock`, `TokenProvider`, `CloudRunJobs` | M0 files | unchanged (`CloudRunJobs` is M3) | M0 adapters |
| `AdminDirectory`, `SetupRecords` | M0 files | the existence check of `admins/{uid}` (the access rule) and the lenient read of `setup/status` | `adapters/firestore.ts` (M0; fn-admin keeps it) |

`Ports` (`ports/index.ts`) aggregates them with `log: Logger` and `config: RuntimeConfig`; a handler takes
`Pick<Ports, …>`. Google APIs are called over REST with `fetch` (no gRPC clients), with tokens from `TokenProvider`;
firebase-admin is used for Firestore, Auth and the task queue (REST underneath).

### 4.1 Upstream failures

`UpstreamError(service, failure, {status?, retryAfterSeconds?})` (`ports/errors.ts`, done) is what every adapter throws;
`InvalidDocumentError(path, issues)` is what `DocumentStore` throws for a document its schema refuses.

| Failure | Typical source | Handler maps it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unauthorized` | 401; Mapbox `TokenInvalid`; USGS HTML 403 or `AUTH_INVALID`; tokeninfo 400 | `mapbox.tokenInvalid`, `usgs.credentials`, `claim.tokenInvalid` |
| `forbidden` | 403 with JSON (a missing role or scope; `SERVICE_DISABLED` sets `api`) | `cloud.permission`, `cloud.apiDisabled`, `mapbox.missingScopes`, `mapbox.mintRefused` |
| `notFound` / `conflict` | 404 / 409, `ifGenerationMatch` | `notFound` / `conflict`, or idempotent success |
| `rateLimited` | 429, USGS `RATE_LIMIT` | `rateLimited` |
| `maintenance` | USGS HTML 503 "Application Offline" | `usgs.maintenance` |
| `unavailable` | other 5xx, network, timeout | `mapbox.unavailable`, `usgs.unavailable`, `errorReporting.unavailable`, `unavailable` |
| `invalid` | 400 or 422 about our request, an unreadable answer | `mapbox.mintRefused`, `photo.unreadable`, `internal` |

### 4.2 Runtime configuration

`RuntimeConfig` (`ports/runtime-config.ts`) is built by `deps.ts` from the environment: `projectId` (`GCLOUD_PROJECT`),
`region` `us-central1`, `buckets` (`<project>.firebasestorage.app`, `<project>-public`), `viewerOrigins`
(`HCM_VIEWER_ORIGINS`, default `https://ventura8.github.io`), `adminOrigins` (`https://<project>.web.app`,
`https://<project>.firebaseapp.com`), `adminUrl`, `oauthClientIds` (`HCM_OAUTH_CLIENT_IDS`: the Google sign-in
provider's web client), `errorEndpoint`, `appCheck` (`HCM_APP_CHECK`). The emulator values live in the planned
`e2e/env` (no secret among them).

### 4.3 IAM this adds to security review §1.1

`fn-admin@`: `roles/firebase.viewer` (Firebase Management) and `roles/errorreporting.viewer` (`groupStats`). Resource
Manager needs no role: `admin.claim` uses the caller's own token. `ops.tick` needs `mapbox-sk-bootstrap` (token
retirement, the daily Mapbox check) and Firebase Auth (stale accounts), which `fn-events@` does not hold: the proposal
is to run `ops.tick` as `fn-admin@`, which holds both already, rather than widen `fn-events@`
(`DECISIONS-for-review.md` §19b). These join the `iam` item of the Provision cloud doctor (CR-M2-5).

## 5. Functions layout

```text
functions/src/
  index.ts             integrator: export * as admin, admins, history, telemetry, setup, publish, photos, ops
  global-options.ts    integrator: region, maxInstances, the runtime service account per family
  deps.ts              integrator: composition root (RuntimeConfig, adapters), created on first use
  api/                 contracts (done): defineCallable, requireAccess, ApiError, toHttpsError
  ports/               contracts (done): the port interfaces, UpstreamError, InvalidDocumentError
  admin/  history/  telemetry/       fn-admin: one file per function (trigger + pure handler), helpers next to them
  setup/                             fn-setup
  photos/  publish/  ops/            fn-content
  adapters/            each adapter's owner (§4)
```

A function file exports its trigger, built with `defineCallable` (callables) or the v2 `onRequest`,
`onDocumentWrittenWithAuthContext`, `onObjectFinalized`, `onTaskDispatched`, `onSchedule`, `onMessagePublished`, and
its pure handler; the folder's `index.ts` re-exports the triggers under their registry names (`export { claim } from
'./claim.js'` in `admin/index.ts`). Handlers never import `firebase-functions`. Every trigger takes `getDeps` from
`deps.ts` (integrator); until the integrator wires the new ports, a workstream builds its `Pick<Ports, …>` from fakes
in its tests. `functions/test/index.test.ts` (integrator) checks that the exports are exactly the registry's
`deployedName`s.

## 6. Scenario rows registered (planned)

New and refined rows in `e2e/scenarios.json` (the generated `docs/E2E_SCENARIOS.md` lists them all):

- **A01** owner claim: `S-A01-HAPPY` (the Resource Manager proof), `S-A01-BAD-NOT-OWNER`, `S-A01-BAD-FOREIGN-TOKEN`,
  `S-A01-BAD-ALREADY-CLAIMED`, plus the refined stranger, popup and claim-delay rows.
- **A02** invitations: `S-A02-HAPPY` (hash only, `admin.join`), `S-A02-BAD-EXPIRED-INVITE`, `S-A02-BAD-OTHER-ADDRESS`,
  `S-A02-BAD-NO-ADDRESS-STORED`; `S-A02-BAD-LAST-ADMIN` became "an admin cannot remove themselves".
- **A03–A07** setup: the status screen with six areas and the self-test (`S-A03-BAD-SELFTEST-FAILURE`,
  `S-A03-BAD-NOTHING-SECRET-LEAVES`); A04 is now "Google Cloud billing and provisioning" (`S-A04-HAPPY-PROVISION`,
  `S-A04-BAD-ORG-POLICY`); A05 detects the demo plan through a refused mint; A06 `S-A06-HAPPY-ROTATE`,
  `S-A06-BAD-SAVED-TWICE`; A07 `S-A07-BAD-TOKEN-EXPIRING`.
- **A20** session: `S-A20-BAD-UNVERIFIED-ACCOUNT`, `S-A20-BAD-NO-APP-CHECK`.
- **A22** analytics and crash setup: `S-A22-BAD-MISSING-ROLE`.
- **A23**, new, edit history and revert (the brief called it A22, which was taken): `S-A23-HAPPY`,
  `S-A23-BAD-INVALID-SNAPSHOT`, `S-A23-BAD-CREATION-ENTRY`, `S-A23-BAD-CLIENT-WRITE` (rules tier).
- **A24**, new, the crash reporting endpoint (the brief's A23): `S-A24-HAPPY`, `S-A24-BAD-FOREIGN-ORIGIN`,
  `S-A24-BAD-RATE-LIMITED`, `S-A24-BAD-TOO-LARGE`, `S-A24-BAD-INVALID-BODY`.

Rows on the `functions` tier are named by `functions/test/**`, the `rules` row by `firebase/rules-tests/**` (an `@S-…`
tag); `e2e-admin` rows wait for the admin UI and its emulator tier.

## 7. Fixtures and fakes (the fakes workstream)

`packages/test-support/src/api-fixtures/` holds JSON response bodies, one file per upstream call and outcome, shared by
the functions' adapter tests, the admin's e2e mock server (`e2e/mock-apis/`) and the Python pipeline later; every value
is a generated test value that names its scenario (no real token, key, address or id; values shaped like Google keys
or tokens are assembled at run time, as `e2e/fixtures/world.ts` does). At least:

- Mapbox Tokens API: `GET /tokens/v2` valid `sk` / valid `pk` / `TokenInvalid` (401); `GET /tokens/v2/{user}` with all
  bootstrap scopes and with some missing; `POST` created (public and secret), 403 (demo account), 422 (billing);
  `PATCH` updated; `DELETE` 204; 5xx.
- USGS M2M: `login-token` ok, JSON `AUTH_INVALID` (HTTP 500), HTML 403, HTML 503 "Application Offline",
  `RATE_LIMIT`; `permissions` with and without download; `logout`.
- Google: tokeninfo (the owner, another account, another client, missing scope, expired 400), Resource Manager
  `testIamPermissions` (granted, empty, 403), Firebase Management `webApps` (one active, none) and `config` (with and
  without `measurementId`, 403, `SERVICE_DISABLED`), Error Reporting `groupStats` (two groups, empty, 503), Cloud
  Billing `billingInfo` and `billingAccounts` (enabled, none), Budgets `create`.
- A fake `fetch` (route table → `Response`, recording each call) in `packages/test-support/src/fakes/`, so adapter tests
  need no msw; the e2e mock server serves the same fixtures over HTTP.

`functions/test/support/` holds the in-memory port fakes: a `DocumentStore` over a `Map` that validates like the
adapter, `AuthAdmin`, `SecretStore` (exists: `adapters/secret-store-memory.ts`), `TaskQueue`, `BlobStore`,
`ImageProcessor`, `GoogleIam`, `FirebaseManagement`, `ErrorReporter`, `MapboxApi`, `UsgsApi` (each scripted per test,
recording its calls), plus the existing clock, logger and caller helpers.

## 8. i18n

The backend's messages are `packages/shared/src/i18n/api/{ro,en}.ts` (47 codes, Romanian first, typed `ApiMessages`),
checked by the `i18n` gate, which now reads every folder directly inside a `packages/*/src/i18n/` folder too. They are
never part of the viewer bundle (the engine imports none of them; `@hcm/shared` has no side effects). The admin's own
UI texts belong to the admin workstream (its own catalogue, `packages/admin/src/i18n/`).

## Change requests

A workstream that needs a change outside its paths appends a row here and continues against the current contract;
the integrator (or the owner) applies it. Ids are `CR-M2-<n>`; status `open`, `accepted`, `done` or `rejected`.

| Id | From | Target (owner) | Change | Why | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CR-M2-1 | contracts | rules (`firebase/firestore.rules`, `firebase/storage.rules`, rules tests) | Mirror `CLIENT_WRITES` and §2.3: CR-1 (photo `dateText`, `title.ro` required), CR-4 (POIs, POI categories, history read-only, layer `adjustments`/`year`/`date`, city `photosOverlay`), stamps on job creates and scene triage, server-owned `analytics`/`engine` on cities and the four new photo fields, admin read on `invites`, `manifests`, `setup/owner`; rules tests import `CLIENT_WRITES` so a schema change fails them | M1 CR-1 and CR-4, PLAN Addendum 3, "every document audited" | done (rules: `firebase/firestore.rules` mirrors `CLIENT_WRITES`; `firebase/rules-tests` imports it, the document schemas and the paths; follow-ups CR-M2-26 to CR-M2-28) |
| CR-M2-2 | contracts | integrator (`functions/src/index.ts`, `deps.ts`, `global-options.ts`, `functions/package.json`) | Export every registry function under its `deployedName` (`functions/test/index.test.ts` compares with `CALLABLES`, `HTTP_ENDPOINTS`, `BACKGROUND_FUNCTIONS`); build `RuntimeConfig` and the new ports in `deps.ts`; per-family runtime service accounts; add the npm dependencies the adapters need (`sharp` 0.35.5 for `adapters/image.ts`, already a root devDependency), each pinned and in `functions/dist/package.json` | the workstreams build feature folders against the registry; the composition root is shared | done (integrator: `functions/src/index.ts` exports the 32 registry functions, `functions/test/index.test.ts` compares them; `deps.ts` builds `RuntimeConfig` and every port but `jobs` (M3); `global-options.ts` `runAs`; `sharp` 0.35.5 in `functions/package.json` and `functions/dist/package.json`; Addendum A) |
| CR-M2-3 | contracts | integrator, ask first (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`) | Layering rules for `functions/`: handlers and `api/` never import `firebase-admin` or `google-auth-library`; only `adapters/` do; feature folders import each other only through `ports/`, `api/` and `@hcm/shared` | keeps the handlers pure and the three workstreams independent | open (ask-first proposal, `DECISIONS-for-review.md` §19a; the integrated tree follows it: feature folders share helpers only through `functions/src/api/`) |
| CR-M2-4 | contracts | engine-core (`packages/engine/src/telemetry/errors.ts`, `telemetry-port.ts`) | Use `redactText` and the `ErrorReport` type of `@hcm/shared` instead of the engine's copies (same rules, plus `ya29.` access tokens) | one redaction rule and one report shape for the reporter and the endpoint | done (viewer workstream: `errors.ts` imports `redactText` of `@hcm/shared`; `ErrorReportPayload` and `ErrorSource` are `ErrorReport` and `ErrorReport['source']`) |
| CR-M2-5 | contracts | the provisioner (admin, Provision cloud `iam` item) and the bootstrap | The roles of §4.3 | Firebase Management, Error Reporting, stale-user cleanup and token retirement | done (M2b: the provisioner's `iam` item binds the role table, `packages/admin/src/provision/resources.ts`; the code side was done in M2) |
| CR-M2-6 | contracts | e2e-infra / admin (`e2e/**`) | The admin tier under the emulators (auth, firestore, storage, functions on `functions/dist`) with the mock Google, Mapbox and USGS APIs serving the §7 fixtures; `e2e/env` with the `HCM_*` values of §4.2 | the `e2e-admin` rows of §6 | done (M2b: the admin tier of `e2e/projects.ts`, the emulators of `e2e/admin/world.ts` and the owner's journey `e2e/admin/specs/journey.spec.ts`) |
| CR-M2-7 | contracts | pipeline (M3, `pipeline/src/hcm_pipeline`) | Job documents and log lines follow `jobDocSchema` / `jobLogDocSchema` (stamp `system:pipeline` required, `steps`, `lease`, `machine`, `attempt`) | the pipeline writes the same documents the functions and the admin read | open (M3) |
| CR-M2-8 | fn-admin | integrator (`functions/src/index.ts`, `deps.ts`, `global-options.ts`) | Wire the fn-admin families as exported objects: `export const admin = adminFunctions(getDeps)`, `admins = adminsFunctions(getDeps)`, `history = historyFunctions(getDeps)`, `telemetry = telemetryFunctions(getDeps)` (`functions/src/{admin,history,telemetry}/index.ts`; Firebase deploys an exported object's functions as `<export>-<key>`). `getDeps()` must return `Ports` (at least `log`, `clock`, `config`, `admins`, `documents` = `createDocumentStore(getFirestore(app))`, `auth` = `createAuthAdmin(getAuth(app))`, `errors` = `createErrorReporter({projectId, tokens, fetch, write})` with `write` of `firebase-functions/logger`, `iam` = fn-setup's `adapters/resource-manager.ts`). Service accounts: `fn-admin@` for `admin.*`, `admins.*`, `history.revert`, `telemetry.listGroups`; `fn-events@` for `history.on*Write` and `telemetry.reportError` (it only writes a log entry: no role) | §5 asks each function file to import `getDeps` from `deps.ts`, whose M0 `Deps` lacks the M2 ports, so a direct import breaks `tsc` for every workstream until CR-M2-2 lands; a family factory compiles today and changes only the export statement | done (integrator, Addendum A) |
| CR-M2-9 | fn-admin | contracts (§2.2, §3.2), admin, fakes (`functions/test/support/**`) | History lists newest first by `updatedAt desc`, not by id desc: the Firestore emulator refuses descending key scans (`FAILED_PRECONDITION: Firestore does not support descending key scans`), so `orderBy('__name__', 'desc')` can never be tested. The trigger's skip rule matches any listed `revert` entry with the same `updatedAt` (not only the newest), which also holds when triggers run out of order; trimming still keeps the newest `HISTORY_KEEP` by id. The admin's history panel orders by `updatedAt desc`; the in-memory `DocumentStore` fake supports `orderBy` on a timestamp field and on `__name__` ascending | found by `functions/test/adapters/documents.test.ts` on the emulator | done (fakes: `createFakeDocumentStore` orders by a timestamp field and refuses `__name__` descending; contract: Addendum A amends §3.2) |
| CR-M2-10 | fn-admin | integrator (`e2e/scenarios.json`, `docs/E2E_SCENARIOS.md`) | Flip to `exists` the rows the fn-admin tests name: `S-A01-BAD-FOREIGN-TOKEN`, `S-A01-BAD-ALREADY-CLAIMED`, `S-A02-BAD-EXPIRED-INVITE` (the `admin.join` half; the `ops.tick` deletion is fn-content's), `S-A02-BAD-NO-ADDRESS-STORED`, `S-A20-BAD-UNVERIFIED-ACCOUNT`, `S-A23-BAD-INVALID-SNAPSHOT`, `S-A23-BAD-CREATION-ENTRY`, `S-A24-HAPPY`, `S-A24-BAD-FOREIGN-ORIGIN`, `S-A24-BAD-RATE-LIMITED`, `S-A24-BAD-TOO-LARGE`, `S-A24-BAD-INVALID-BODY`; regenerate the doc. `S-A20-BAD-NO-APP-CHECK` stays planned: firebase-functions checks App Check on the HTTP path, which `.run()` skips (e2e-admin tier) | the `e2e-matrix` gate fails while a `planned` row is named by a test | done (integrator: the 12 rows `exists`, `docs/E2E_SCENARIOS.md` regenerated; `S-A02-BAD-EXPIRED-INVITE` also names `functions/test/ops/accounts.test.ts`) |
| CR-M2-11 | fn-admin | contracts (`functions/src/ports/errors.ts`, §4.1, §5) | (a) `UpstreamError` gains `api?: string` for `SERVICE_DISABLED` (§4.1 says it sets `api`, the class has no such field); until then `telemetry.listGroups` answers every `forbidden` with `cloud.permission` naming `roles/errorreporting.viewer`, a disabled API included. (b) §5 "exports its pure handler": the fn-admin handlers stay module-local unless a test imports them (`recordHistory`, `handleErrorReport`), because knip fails on unused exports; tests drive them through `.run()`. (c) `VerifiedCaller` has no display name: `admin.claim` and `admin.join` read it with `AuthAdmin.getUser` | the contract as written cannot be met as is | done (integrator: (a) `UpstreamError.api`, set by `GoogleApiError` and the Error Reporting adapter; `telemetry.listGroups` answers `cloud.apiDisabled {api}`; (b) and (c) accepted as written, Addendum A) |
| CR-M2-12 | fn-admin | integrator (`docs/*.md`, `.agent/**`, `.agents/skills/**`, `.claude/skills/**`) | Sync the docs: `functions_skill.md` (family factories, the real Firestore and Auth adapters on the emulators with a fresh named database per test, `functions/test/admin/world.ts`), `analytics_and_crash_skill.md` (the per-client key is the last `X-Forwarded-For` hop; at most 2 × 120 reports a minute project-wide; a stack frame is parsed before redaction; a preflight from a foreign origin is 405; refusals after the origin check carry `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; Firefox and Safari stacks get the message in front), `rules_and_emulators_skill.md` (no descending key scans on the emulator), `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; `docs/LESSONS.md`: the emulator refuses `__name__ desc` (pinned by the documents adapter test), and `redactText` drops a frame's `:line:col` with the query of its URL (pinned by `functions/test/telemetry/error-event.test.ts`) | fn-admin owns no doc or agent asset | done (integrator: the skills, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md` #30 and #31) |
| CR-M2-13 | fn-setup | integrator (`functions/src/index.ts`, `deps.ts`, `global-options.ts`) | Wire `export const setup = defineSetupFunctions(getDeps)` (`functions/src/setup/index.ts`, deployed as `setup-<name>`) in place of the M0 `export * as setup from './triggers/setup.js'`. In `deps.ts`: `secrets` = `createSecretManagerStore({projectId, tokens, fetch, clock, log, ttlMs: 300_000, revision: secretsRevision(setupRecords)})` (`adapters/secret-manager.ts`, which replaces `createRestSecretStore`; the memory store stays for the emulator), `mapbox` = `createMapboxApi({fetch})`, `usgs` = `createUsgsApi({fetch, log})`, `firebase` = `createFirebaseManagement({tokens, fetch})`, `iam` = `createGoogleIam({fetch})` (`adapters/resource-manager.ts`, also used by `admin.claim`). Every `setup.*` runs as `fn-admin@`. Once `index.ts` and `deps.ts` stop importing them, fn-setup deletes the M0 leftovers: `functions/src/{triggers,handlers}/`, `functions/src/adapters/secret-store-rest.ts`, `functions/test/{triggers,handlers}/`, `functions/test/adapters/secret-store-rest.test.ts`. They stay for now because deleting them breaks `tsc` for every workstream | same reason as CR-M2-8: a family factory compiles against the M0 `Deps`, and only the export statement changes | done (integrator: `setup = defineSetupFunctions(getDeps)`, the adapters wired, every `setup.*` as `fn-admin@`; the M0 `triggers/`, `handlers/`, `secret-store-rest.ts` and their tests deleted) |
| CR-M2-14 | fn-setup | integrator (`deps.ts`) and e2e-infra (`e2e/env`, CR-M2-6) | In the Functions emulator (`FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR=true`) the REST adapters must never reach a real host. `deps.ts` should pass them a `fetch` that sends `api.mapbox.com`, `m2m.cr.usgs.gov`, `oauth2.googleapis.com` and `*.googleapis.com` to the mock APIs (a base URL such as `HCM_UPSTREAM_BASE` in `e2e/env`) and refuses every other host. The adapters take `fetch` injected and hard-code only the public base URLs | the `setup.*` callables call Mapbox, USGS and Google directly, and nothing in M2 may touch a real endpoint | done (integrator: `functions/src/adapters/emulator-fetch.ts`; the `e2e/env` values stay with CR-M2-6) |
| CR-M2-15 | fn-setup | contracts (`functions/src/ports/mapbox-api.ts`, `secret-store.ts`, `packages/shared/src/schemas/paths.ts`) | (a) Add `MapboxApi.listTilesets(user, token, limit)` → `{id, name?}[]`. It is already implemented and tested (`MapboxTilesetsApi` in `adapters/mapbox.ts`) against the fake's `/tilesets/v1`. The M3 publisher uses it to find Studio uploads; it is also onboarding §2B step B5.3. (b) Add `FIRESTORE_PATHS.cities` (`'cities'`): until then, `setup/self-test-checks.ts` queries the collection with a literal. (c) The `UpstreamError.api` of CR-M2-11 (a): fn-setup's `GoogleApiError` (`adapters/google-call.ts`) already carries it, and `setup/failures.ts` reads it with `'api' in error`, so `cloud.apiDisabled {api}` works today for Firebase Management, Secret Manager and Cloud Storage. (d) The comment on `SecretStore.write` should also say that older enabled versions are destroyed (security review §1.2) | the port and the path list are contracts-owned | done for (b) `FIRESTORE_PATHS.cities`, (c) `UpstreamError.api`, (d) the `SecretStore.write` comment; (a) `MapboxApi.listTilesets` joins the port with its first user, the M3 publisher (the adapter already has it) |
| CR-M2-16 | fn-setup | contracts (`packages/shared/src/i18n/api/{ro,en}.ts`, `api/errors.ts`) | Add the code `apiError.usgs.accessPending` (`failed-precondition`). RO: „USGS nu a aprobat încă accesul M2M pentru acest cont. Verificăm din nou la fiecare 6 ore.” EN: "USGS has not approved M2M access for this account yet. We check again every 6 hours." Then `usgsRecord` (`functions/src/setup/usgs-check.ts`) sets it as the `detail` of a `pending` USGS record: a login refused with `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` (the account has no M2M access), or a `permissions` list without `download`. Mapbox needs no new code: a demo account (403 on token creation) and unconfirmed billing (422) both answer `apiError.mapbox.mintRefused`, whose message already names the step | the missing MACHINE role should be an actionable reason on the record, like every other area's | done (integrator: `apiError.usgs.accessPending` (`failed-precondition`), set on every `pending` USGS record by `setup.*` and `ops.tick`) |
| CR-M2-17 | fn-setup | fakes (`packages/test-support/src/fakes/`, `api-fixtures/`) | (a) tokeninfo should also read the token from `Authorization: Bearer` on POST. That is google-auth-library's `getTokenInfo` shape, which `adapters/resource-manager.ts` uses so that the token never appears in a URL or a body. Today the fake reads only the query or the form body, so in the e2e tier every token would read as expired (`functions/test/adapters/resource-manager.test.ts` answers tokeninfo from its own route table meanwhile). (b) Add a USGS account without M2M access: `login-token` answering `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` (M2M itself spells it `AUTH_UNAUTHROIZED`; the adapter accepts both), e.g. `USGS_CREDENTIALS.noAccess` with a fixture `usgs/login-token.no-m2m-access.json`. (c) Secret Manager `versions.list` should honour `filter=state:ENABLED` (today it also lists `DISABLED` versions) | the e2e tier runs the same adapters against these fakes | done (fakes: tokeninfo also reads `Authorization: Bearer`; `USGS_CREDENTIALS.noAccess` with `usgs/login-token.no-m2m-access.json`, `AUTH_UNAUTHROIZED`, approved by `usgs.m2mApproved`; `versions.list` honours `filter=state:<STATE>` and lists destroyed versions otherwise, as Secret Manager does) |
| CR-M2-18 | fn-setup | fn-content (`functions/src/ops/**`) | (a) The `health` step should check USGS again when `state` is `pending` **or** `unavailable` and `nextCheckAt` has passed: `setup.saveUsgs` keeps credentials pasted during maintenance as `unavailable` with `nextCheckAt` = now + 6 h, and `setup.selfTest` sets `nextCheckAt` the same way. `checkUsgs` and `usgsRecord` (`functions/src/setup/usgs-check.ts`) do the check and build the record. Importing them crosses feature folders (CR-M2-3), so either accept that import or let fn-setup move them to a shared place. (b) The `tokens` step reads `setup/status.mapbox.{user, retiring[]}` and `mapbox-sk-bootstrap`; there are at most 10 retiring entries, because `setup.rotatePublicToken` refuses an 11th with `apiError.rateLimited`. (c) The `task-queue` check of `setup.selfTest` requests a rebuild the way the publish triggers do: on `manifests/{city}`, `requestedVersion` + 1 and `status: 'queued'` (`builtVersion` 0 for a new document, stamped with the caller), then `publish-buildManifest` with `manifestTaskId`. Please confirm the builder accepts that | these are shared records and protocols between `setup.*` and `ops.tick` | done by fn-content: (a) `ops/services.ts` checks USGS again at `nextCheckAt` while `pending` or `unavailable`, and a check that finds USGS unavailable sets `nextCheckAt` = now + 6 h; its own implementation, no import across feature folders; (b) as built (`retireTokens`); (c) confirmed: the builder starts from the larger of the document's and the task's `requestedVersion`, a new document with `builtVersion` 0 is fine |
| CR-M2-19 | fn-setup | integrator (`e2e/scenarios.json`, `docs/E2E_SCENARIOS.md`) | Flip to `exists` the two `functions`-tier rows the fn-setup tests name, then regenerate the doc: `S-A03-BAD-NOTHING-SECRET-LEAVES` (`functions/test/setup/status.test.ts`) and `S-A06-BAD-SAVED-TWICE` (`functions/test/setup/save-mapbox.test.ts`). The `e2e-admin` rows of A03–A07 and A22 stay `planned`; their backend half is covered by `functions/test/setup/*.test.ts` without tags | the `e2e-matrix` gate fails while a `planned` row is named by a test | done (integrator) |
| CR-M2-20 | fn-setup | integrator (`docs/*.md`, `.agent/**`, `.agents/skills/**`, `.claude/skills/**`) | Sync the docs. `functions_skill.md`: `defineSetupFunctions`; the setup tests run the real REST adapters over `createUpstreamFakes()` with a per-test `intercept` (`functions/test/setup/world.ts`); Secret Manager writes a version and destroys the older enabled ones, and its read cache is keyed by `secretsRev`. `pipeline/usgs_m2m_skill.md`: the adapter's failure table, including `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` → `forbidden` → `pending`; a paste during maintenance is kept as `unavailable`; logout always runs. `pipeline/mapbox_publishing_skill.md`: token notes `historic-city-map <project> <purpose> [city] (auto)` (purpose `viewer`, `admin` or `tiles`), found by id and then by note so a half-finished save never adds tokens; leftover tiles tokens are deleted; the retiring list. `web/admin_setup_assistant_skill.md`: a failed save records its reason on the card unless the card holds a working or pending configuration. `quality/ci_quality_gates_skill.md`: ESLint `complexity` counts optional chaining (`?.`); `sonarjs/super-linear-regex` flags a `Link`-header regex, so split the header instead. Also `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.{ro,en}.md` (a USGS paste during maintenance is kept and checked later) | fn-setup owns no doc or agent asset | done (integrator: `functions_skill.md`, `usgs_m2m_skill.md`, `mapbox_publishing_skill.md`, `admin_setup_assistant_skill.md`, `ci_quality_gates_skill.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, both admin guides) |
| CR-M2-21 | fakes | e2e-infra / admin (`e2e/support/network.ts`, `e2e/support/test.ts`; CR-M2-6) | The mock APIs already serve the fake upstreams (`createUpstreamExtension()` in `e2e/mock-apis/main.ts`, one world per `x-hcm-test`). The admin projects' browser network should forward `upstreamHosts()` of `@hcm/test-support/fakes` to them and add `authorization` to `FORWARDED_HEADERS` (the viewer projects keep today's allowlist, so a viewer that reached Google is still blocked), and an admin fixture should drive `/__upstream/scenario`, `/__upstream/fail` and `/__upstream/calls` with the test's id | the admin's browser calls Cloud Billing, Service Usage, IAM, Resource Manager and Firebase Management directly (PLAN Addendum 1) | done (M2b: `forwardUpstreams` of the admin projects, `e2e/support/network.ts`) |
| CR-M2-22 | fakes | integrator (`deps.ts`) and e2e-infra (`e2e/env`), with CR-M2-14 | The emulator `fetch` of CR-M2-14 rewrites `https://<host><path>` to `<HCM_UPSTREAM_BASE>/h/<host><path>` (the mock APIs on `127.0.0.1:4311` answer it; `startUpstreamServer({port})` of `@hcm/test-support/fakes/http` is the same fakes on a port of their own) and forwards the callable request's `x-hcm-test` header when there is one. Calls without it share the partition `''`: a test that changes upstream state through the control endpoints runs alone or relies on the scenario credentials, which need no state | the Functions emulator's adapters reach the same fakes as the browser, per test | partly done (integrator: the rewrite to `<HCM_UPSTREAM_BASE>/h/<host><path>`, loopback bases only, in `emulator-fetch.ts`); forwarding the callable request's `x-hcm-test` needs the request in scope of the adapters (an `AsyncLocalStorage` in `defineCallable`), open for M2b with CR-M2-6 |
| CR-M2-23 | fakes | contracts (`functions/src/ports/errors.ts`) | `UpstreamService` has no member for the image processor, whose `inspect` rejects with `UpstreamError` `invalid` (§3.6): add `'image'`. `createFakeImageProcessor` uses `'cloud-storage'` meanwhile | an unreadable photo is not a Cloud Storage failure | done (integrator: `UpstreamService` `'image'`, thrown by `adapters/image.ts` and the image fake) |
| CR-M2-24 | fakes | integrator (`.agent/**`, `.agents/skills/**`, `.claude/skills/**`, `docs/research/M0-handoff.md`) | Sync the agent assets with the fakes (`docs/TESTING.md` → *Fake upstreams* is done): `testing_strategy_skill.md` *Seams and fakes* (fixtures `@hcm/test-support/api-fixtures`, `createFakeFetch`/`routeTable`, `createUpstreamFakes` with `scenario`/`fail`, the HTTP server and its partitions, the port fakes of `functions/test/support/`, the credential constants `GOOGLE_TOKENS`, `MAPBOX_TOKENS`, `USGS_CREDENTIALS`), `e2e_scenario_matrix_skill.md` (the mock APIs' `MockExtension` and `/__upstream/…`), `functions_skill.md` *Tests*, an M0-handoff entry. Lessons: a fixture `call` that does not start with its method was caught by the catalogue test; prettier's line breaks pushed fakes past `max-lines-per-function`, so a service's routes are built by helper functions | the fakes workstream owns no agent asset | done (integrator: `testing_strategy_skill.md`, `e2e_scenario_matrix_skill.md`, `functions_skill.md`; the entry in `M0-handoff.md` §10p) |
| CR-M2-25 | fakes | fn-content (`functions/test/ops/fakes.ts`, `functions/test/publish/fakes.ts`) | Optional: the shared fakes now exist (`createFakeAuthAdmin`, `createFakeMapboxApi`, `createFakeUsgsApi`, `createFakeBlobStore`, `createFakeTaskQueue`, `createFakeDocumentStore` in `functions/test/support/`); the local copies can go | one fake per port keeps the scenario credentials the same in every tier | declined for M2 by fn-content: its local fakes also carry the movable clock, `contentDeps`, `adminCall` and the `put`/`object`/`paths` helpers 250 tests use; switching to the shared fakes is a mechanical follow-up |
| CR-M2-26 | rules | integrator (`e2e/scenarios.json`, `docs/E2E_SCENARIOS.md`) | Flip `S-A23-BAD-CLIENT-WRITE` (tier `rules`) to `exists`: `firebase/rules-tests/test/history.test.ts` names it for each of the five audited entities. Regenerate the doc | the `e2e-matrix` gate fails while a `planned` row is named by a test | done (integrator) |
| CR-M2-27 | rules | integrator (`docs/*.md`, `.agent/**`, `.agents/skills/**`, `.claude/skills/**`) | Sync the docs with the M2 rules. `rules_and_emulators_skill.md`: the personas (`anonymous`, `stranger`, `invited`, `unverified`, `otherProvider`, `revoked` = claim without document, `pending` = document without claim, `admin`); the test files (`matrix.test.ts`: every persona × collection × get, list, create, update, delete; `client-writes.test.ts`: each `CLIENT_WRITES` field allowed, each other schema field refused, read back through zod; `documents.test.ts`: the fixtures are complete, schema-valid documents; `limits.test.ts`; `indexes.test.ts`); one cached context per persona (a context per request made the suite 3× slower); **the 1000-expression limit**: a request evaluating more is denied, every reference to a function argument evaluates the argument again (about ten per check), so a text is one bounded pattern (`[\s\S]{1,200}`, chained blocks above 1000), an optional field is checked with its neutral default (`data.get('bearing', 0)`), and the heaviest legitimate write (a photo with every field and five links, every editable field of a city at once) uses about 650 of 1000; the whole document is validated on every write, the photo location against the city only on create and when it changes, the publish gate only when `published` or `license` changes; `gcps` is gone until M3. Storage: a photo upload needs the photo document (`firestore.exists`, the second cross-service call of the request), a name of `UPLOAD_FILE_PATTERN`, 1 byte to 60 MiB, `originalName` up to 255 characters; raster upload ids follow `ID_PATTERN`. `docs/LESSONS.md`: the expression limit (found by `photos.test.ts`: every full photo create was denied, the emulator's `firestore-debug.log` names it) and the argument re-evaluation. `docs/TESTING.md` (rules tier: about 715 tests, 30 s), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (rules summary, indexes) | the rules workstream owns no doc or agent asset | done (integrator: `rules_and_emulators_skill.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md` #29) |
| CR-M2-28 | rules | contracts (§2.3, §2.4) and the admin | Write into the contract what the rules enforce beyond `CLIENT_WRITES`, so the admin never meets a surprise denial: (a) an optional text that is blank but not empty passes the rules and is refused by the server's zod read, so the admin validates with the shared schemas before every write; required titles (`title.ro`, `name.ro`, `label.ro`) are refused blank by the rules too; (b) photo, POI, POI category and job ids follow `ID_PATTERN`, and no category is called `photos` (`PHOTOS_OVERLAY_ID`); (c) a photo's location lies within the city bounds ± 0.5° on create and whenever it changes; (d) publishing (or changing the licence of) a photo needs `processing: 'done'`, an `image` and a licence other than `unknown`; unpublishing is always allowed; (e) a job can be cancelled only while it is not `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`; (f) a scene's `status` may be set to `candidate`, `ordered` or `rejected` only, its `note` changed whatever the status; (g) the admin's queries have these composite indexes (`firebase/firestore.indexes.json`): photos by `published`, `processing`, `license` or `rightsReview` then `updatedAt desc`; POIs by `category` or `published` then `updatedAt desc`; layers by `published` then `order`; jobs by `status` then `createdAt` (both directions); history by `action` then `updatedAt desc`. Ordering a single collection by one field needs no entry (and a history is listed by `updatedAt desc`, CR-M2-9) | the admin is built against the contract, not the rules file | done (integrator: Addendum A, written into the contract) |
| CR-M2-29 | fn-content | integrator (`functions/src/index.ts`, `deps.ts`, `global-options.ts`, `functions/package.json`) | Wire `export const photos = photosFunctions(getDeps)`, `publish = publishFunctions(getDeps)`, `ops = opsFunctions(getDeps)` (`functions/src/{photos,publish,ops}/index.ts`, deployed as `<group>-<key>`), as CR-M2-8 and CR-M2-13. `getDeps()` must cover their `PhotosDeps`, `PublishDeps` and `OpsDeps`: `blobs` = `createStorageBlobStore(getStorage(app), config.buckets)`, `tasks` = `createCloudTaskQueue(getFunctions(app), config.region)`, `images` = `createSharpImageProcessor()`, plus `log`, `clock`, `config`, `documents`, `admins`, `auth`, `secrets`, `mapbox`, `usgs`. `functions/package.json`: `"sharp": "0.35.5"` (external, so it lands in `functions/dist/package.json`; Cloud Build installs the Linux x64 prebuilt). `photos.onUpload` resolves its bucket when `index.ts` loads (`FIREBASE_CONFIG.storageBucket`, or pass `config.buckets.private` as `photosFunctions(getDeps, bucket)`'s second argument): `functions/test/index.test.ts` must stub `FIREBASE_CONFIG` or pass the bucket. Service accounts: `fn-events@` for `photos.onUpload`, `publish.on*Write` and `publish.buildManifest`; `fn-admin@` for `ops.tick` (§19b), `ops.onBudget`, `photos.reprocess` and `publish.rebuildManifest` | same reason as CR-M2-8: family factories compile against the M0 `Deps`; the adapters and `sharp` are fn-content's, the composition root is not | done (integrator, Addendum A; `photos.onUpload` gets `privateBucket(env)`, the bucket the Storage adapter writes) |

Export the photo as JPEG (on an iPhone: Settings → Camera → Formats → Most Compatible) and upload it again." Drop HEIC from `apiError.photo.unsupportedType` ("Only JPEG, PNG, WebP or TIFF photos are accepted."). Then `HEIC_ERROR` in `functions/src/photos/upload.ts` becomes the new code (one line) and its test expectation follows | sharp's prebuilt libvips reads AVIF only (`sharp.format.heif.input.fileSuffix` is `['.avif']`), so HEIC cannot be converted on the server as security review §1.7 assumed; testability review asks for an actionable message (S-A08-BAD-UNSUPPORTED-TYPE).

| CR-M2-31 | fn-content | contracts (`functions/src/ports/image-processor.ts`, `errors.ts`, `packages/shared/src/schemas/paths.ts`, `functions/src/api/`) | (a) `ImageProcessor.inspect`'s comment: the adapter reports the size of an image over the pixel limit (header only, never decoded) instead of rejecting, so `photos.onUpload` answers `photo.tooLarge`; `webp` enforces `limitInputPixels`. (b) `UpstreamService` `'image'` (= CR-M2-23): `adapters/image.ts` throws `cloud-storage` `invalid` meanwhile. (c) `FIRESTORE_PATHS.cities` (= CR-M2-15 b): `ops/manifests.ts` uses the literal. (d) The derivative metadata key `writtenAt` as a shared constant beside `STORAGE_PATHS`: `photos/upload.ts` writes it on every public derivative, `ops/manifests.ts` reads it; each keeps a copy. (e) `compact` and `omit` in `functions/src/api/` (or `@hcm/shared`): `photos/objects.ts` and `ops/objects.ts` are copies because feature folders may not import each other (CR-M2-3). (f) The secondary port types fn-content first imported are now exported: `BucketRole`, `BlobMetadata`, `WriteOptions` (`blob-store.ts`), `ExifSummary`, `ImageInspection` (`image-processor.ts`), `StoredDocument`, `InvalidDocument`, `QueryResult` (`documents.ts`), `AuthUser` (`auth-admin.ts`) | contract text and shared names | done (integrator: (a) the port comment, (b) = CR-M2-23, (c) = CR-M2-15 (b), (d) `DERIVATIVE_WRITTEN_AT` in `@hcm/shared`, (e) `compact` and `omit` in `functions/src/api/objects.ts`, (f) done) |
| CR-M2-32 | fn-content | contracts (§3.5–§3.7), review (`DECISIONS-for-review.md` §20a) | Record what fn-content built where the text was silent or differs: (a) an unpublished photo keeps its public derivatives; the sweep deletes only files no photo document and no served manifest names (replaced images, deleted photos), at least `UNPUBLISH_DELETE_MINUTES` after they were written and after the last build (§20a); (b) the sweep runs with the nightly rebuild, once a day, not on every tick (it reads every photo document of the city); (c) a layer is listed when `published` and `status: 'ready'`; a photo when `published`, `processing: 'done'` and with an `image`; every POI category; a POI's `photoIds` keep only listed photos; (d) city defaults: center = middle of the bounds, zoom 13 within min 10 and max 20 unless set, basemap `mapbox://styles/mapbox/standard`; English falls back to Romanian where the manifest needs both; (e) `manifests/{city}`: `error` is `apiError.mapbox.notConfigured` (no public token) or `apiError.invalidRequest` (another city issue, its paths logged), a failed build keeps the last good `url`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `counts`, `builtAt` and `builtVersion`; `sha256` is the manifest JSON's, `bytes` the stored gzip size; an unpublished or deleted city has its manifest deleted (`status: 'idle'`); (f) a manifest above `MANIFEST_SPLIT_BYTES` is still published, with a warning log (the split waits for the engine); (g) a document refused for its own fields is dropped first, the rules across documents run on the next pass (zod skips an object's refinements while a field is invalid) | the contract should say what the code does | done (integrator: Addendum A, written into the contract) |

The admin's e2e tier needs either `HCM_ADMIN_ORIGINS` and `HCM_ERROR_ENDPOINT` overrides in `deps.ts` (a contract change of §4.2) or a Hosting emulator origin it can accept as is | `telemetry.reportError` checks the `Origin` against these lists, and `admins.invite` answers `adminUrl` | partly done (M2b: `HCM_ADMIN_ORIGINS` is set in the emulator's environment; reading it is CR-M2b-4, which must keep the minted admin token's https origins) |
| CR-M2-40 | integrator | admin (`packages/admin/src/`) | Show the codes added during the integration: `apiError.usgs.accessPending` as the reason of a `pending` USGS card, `apiError.photo.heicUnsupported` on a refused HEIC photo, `apiError.cloud.apiDisabled` (`{api}`) from `telemetry.listGroups` with the deep link that enables the API | the backend answers them since Addendum A | done (M2b: setup-ui shows every code, `packages/admin/src/setup/messages.ts`) |

## Addendum A: integration (2026-10-12)

Added by the M2 integrator, alone in the tree after the parallel workstreams (rules, fn-admin, fn-setup, fn-content,
fakes, viewer). Everything below exists and is tested; the change-request table above says what each request became.

### A.1 Wiring

- `functions/src/index.ts` exports eight groups, one per registry namespace, each from its folder's factory:
  `admin`, `admins`, `history`, `telemetry`, `setup`, `publish`, `photos` (`photosFunctions(getDeps,
  privateBucket(process.env))`) and `ops`: the 32 functions of `CALLABLES`, `HTTP_ENDPOINTS` and
  `BACKGROUND_FUNCTIONS`, deployed as `<group>-<name>`. `functions/test/index.test.ts` fails unless the exports are
  exactly the registry, each in `us-central1`, with its registry cap (callables, the crash endpoint) or at most 5, and
  with its service account.
- `functions/src/global-options.ts`: `setGlobalOptions({region: 'us-central1', maxInstances: 5, concurrency: 80,
  serviceAccount: 'fn-events@'})`, and `RUNTIME_ACCOUNTS`, the account of every registry name, applied by
  `runAs(name)` in each trigger's options (`callableOptions` for callables): `fn-admin@` for the 17 callables and
  `ops.*` (§19b option 1), `fn-events@` for the ten Firestore triggers, `photos.onUpload`, `publish.buildManifest` and
  `telemetry.reportError`. `fn-admin@` is firebase-tools' shorthand for `fn-admin@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
- `functions/src/deps.ts`: `Deps` = `Omit<Ports, 'jobs'>` (M3 adds `CloudRunJobs`). `runtimeConfig(env)` follows §4.2,
  with one refinement: `buckets.private` is the `storageBucket` of `FIREBASE_CONFIG` when it names one (the project's
  default bucket, which the Storage rules and the admin's uploads use), else `<project>.firebasestorage.app`. In the
  Functions emulator (`FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR=true`) secrets stay in memory, the REST adapters get
  `createEmulatorFetch(HCM_UPSTREAM_BASE)` (CR-M2-14, CR-M2-22: `https://` calls to `api.mapbox.com`,
  `m2m.cr.usgs.gov` and `*.googleapis.com` go to `<base>/h/<host><path>`, a loopback base only; anything else fails like
  a network error) and a placeholder token instead of Application Default Credentials.
- `functions/build.mjs` bundles everything but the functions' own npm dependencies (`firebase-admin`,
  `firebase-functions`, `google-auth-library`, `sharp`), fails on a bare import that is neither a Node built-in nor
  pinned, and loads the bundle to check every export's deploy manifest. The earlier configuration left `zod` external,
  so the artifact would have crashed at its first cold start (`docs/LESSONS.md` #34). The Functions emulator loads all
  32 functions from `functions/dist/` (`firebase.json` gained the Pub/Sub and Cloud Tasks emulators).
- `firebase.json`: Hosting site `bucurestiul-disparut` with the security review's headers (frames only for the two auth
  domains, Google sign-in and reCAPTCHA); `.firebaserc`: `default: bucurestiul-disparut`, `e2e: demo-hcm`.

### A.2 Contract amendments

- **§3.2 History** (CR-M2-9): a history is listed newest first by `updatedAt` descending, never by id (the Firestore
  emulator refuses descending key scans); the trigger skips a change when any listed `revert` entry has the same
  `updatedAt`; trimming keeps the newest `HISTORY_KEEP` by id.
- **§3.1, §3.2 handlers** (CR-M2-11 b, c): a function file exports its pure handler only when a test imports it (knip
  fails on unused exports); tests drive the rest through `.run()`. `VerifiedCaller` carries no display name:
  `admin.claim` and `admin.join` read it with `AuthAdmin.getUser`.
- **§3.3 USGS** (CR-M2-16): a `pending` USGS record (a `permissions` list without `download`, or a login refused with
  `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED`) carries `detail: apiError.usgs.accessPending` and `nextCheckAt` = now + `USGS_RECHECK_HOURS`,
  written the same way by `setup.saveUsgs`, `setup.selfTest` and `ops.tick`.
- **§3.6 Photos** (CR-M2-30): HEIC and HEIF fail with `apiError.photo.heicUnsupported` (`invalid-argument`; the
  message says how to export a JPEG); `apiError.photo.unsupportedType` names JPEG, PNG, WebP and TIFF only.
  `ImageProcessor.inspect` reads the header only: an image over the pixel limit is reported with its size (the handler
  answers `photo.tooLarge`), HEIC with its type and no size.
- **§4.1 Upstream failures** (CR-M2-11 a, CR-M2-23): `UpstreamError` carries `api` (the Google API a
  `SERVICE_DISABLED` refusal names) and the service `'image'` (bytes sharp cannot read). `telemetry.listGroups`
  answers a disabled Error Reporting API with `apiError.cloud.apiDisabled {api}`.
- **§2.4 Paths and shared names** (CR-M2-15 b, CR-M2-31 d, e): `FIRESTORE_PATHS.cities` (`'cities'`);
  `DERIVATIVE_WRITTEN_AT` (`'writtenAt'`, the custom metadata of every public derivative); `compact` and `omit` in
  `functions/src/api/objects.ts`.
- **§8 i18n**: the API catalogue has 49 codes.
- **What the rules enforce beyond `CLIENT_WRITES`** (CR-M2-28), so the admin never meets a surprise denial: (a) an
  optional text that is blank but not empty passes the rules and is refused by the server's zod read, so the admin
  validates with the shared schemas before every write; required titles (`title.ro`, `name.ro`, `label.ro`) are refused
  blank; (b) photo, POI, POI category and job ids follow `ID_PATTERN`, and no category is called `photos`; (c) a photo's
  location lies within the city bounds ± 0.5° on create and whenever it changes; (d) publishing (or changing the licence
  of) a photo needs `processing: 'done'`, an `image` and a licence other than `unknown`; unpublishing is always allowed;
  (e) a job can be cancelled only while it is not `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`; (f) a scene's `status` may be
  set to `candidate`, `ordered` or `rejected` only, its `note` changed whatever the status; (g) the admin's queries
  have the composite indexes of `firebase/firestore.indexes.json` (photos by `published`, `processing`, `license` or
  `rightsReview` then `updatedAt desc`; POIs by `category` or `published` then `updatedAt desc`; layers by `published`
  then `order`; jobs by `status` then `createdAt`, both directions; history by `action` then `updatedAt desc`).
- **The manifest build as built** (CR-M2-32): (a) an unpublished photo keeps its public derivatives; the sweep deletes
  only files no photo document and no served manifest names, at least `UNPUBLISH_DELETE_MINUTES` after they were
  written and after the last build (`DECISIONS-for-review.md` §20a); (b) the sweep runs with the nightly rebuild, once
  a day; (c) a layer is listed when `published` and `status: 'ready'`, a photo when `published`, `processing: 'done'`
  and with an `image`, every POI category, and a POI's `photoIds` keep only listed photos; (d) city defaults: centre =
  middle of the bounds, zoom 13 within 10 and 20 unless set, basemap `mapbox://styles/mapbox/standard`, English falls
  back to Romanian where the manifest needs both; (e) `manifests/{city}.error` is `apiError.mapbox.notConfigured` (no
  public token) or `apiError.invalidRequest` (another city issue), a failed build keeps the last good `url`, `sha256`,
  `bytes`, `counts`, `builtAt` and `builtVersion`; `sha256` is the manifest JSON's, `bytes` the stored gzip size; an
  unpublished or deleted city has its manifest deleted (`status: 'idle'`); (f) a manifest above `MANIFEST_SPLIT_BYTES`
  is still published, with a warning log; (g) a document refused for its own fields is dropped first, the rules across
  documents run on the next pass (zod skips an object's refinements while a field is invalid).

### A.3 Scenarios

The 15 rows CR-M2-10, CR-M2-19 and CR-M2-26 named are `exists`; CR-M2-33 registered 14 `functions` rows, all `exists`
and tagged: `S-A03-BAD-USGS-STILL-PENDING`, `S-A06-HAPPY-OLD-TOKEN-RETIRED`, `S-A08-HAPPY-PROCESSED`,
`S-A08-BAD-NOT-A-PHOTO`, `S-A08-BAD-HEIC`, `S-A08-BAD-PIXEL-LIMIT`, `S-A08-BAD-DUPLICATE-HASH`,
`S-A08-BAD-STORAGE-DOWN`, `S-A10-HAPPY-MANIFEST-BUILT`, `S-A10-BAD-DOCUMENT-SKIPPED`, `S-A10-BAD-NO-PUBLIC-TOKEN`,
`S-A10-BAD-WRITE-DURING-BUILD`, `S-A10-BAD-NOTHING-TO-PUBLISH`, `S-A20-BAD-STALE-ACCOUNT`. `S-A20-BAD-NO-APP-CHECK`
and every `e2e-admin` row stay `planned` until the admin's emulator tier (M2b).

### A.4 Still open

CR-M2-3 (ask first, §19a), CR-M2-5 and CR-M2-37 (the provisioner), CR-M2-6, CR-M2-21, CR-M2-22 (the `x-hcm-test`
forwarding), CR-M2-39 and CR-M2-40 (M2b), CR-M2-7 (M3), CR-M2-15 (a) (M3). Decisions: `DECISIONS-for-review.md` §22
(deploy-time configuration, a lockfile for `functions/dist/`, sharp at cold start).

## Addendum B: handed over to M2b (2026-10-12)

Added by the M2b contracts agent. The open requests CR-M2-5 (the provisioner's roles), CR-M2-6 and CR-M2-21 (the
admin's e2e tier), CR-M2-22 (the `x-hcm-test` forwarding), CR-M2-37 (the GA4 stream setting), CR-M2-39 (the emulator's
admin origins) and CR-M2-40 (the admin shows the integration's error codes) are assigned to the M2b workstreams in
`M2b-interfaces.md` → *Change requests*. `PROVISION_ITEMS` gained `crash-alerts` and `api-key` (`M2b-interfaces.md`
§0, §3.4); `setup.recordCloud` and `setup.status` accept them unchanged.
