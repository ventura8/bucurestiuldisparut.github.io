# A photo's precise date and its source (the owner's requests, 2026-11-07)

The owner's words: "for pictures we want the ability to set the year or the year and month, or year, month and day" and "for pictures we want the property to link the photo from where we have it". This is the shared contract; `docs/ENGINE_API.md` → `photos[]` is the public one.

## 1. The date

- **Fields**: `month` (1 to 12) and `day` (1 to 31) join `year` and `yearEnd`, optional, on `photoDocSchema` (`cities/{city}/photos/{photo}`) and on `photoSchema` (the manifest). The rules (`validPhoto`) check the same.
- **The rules** (`packages/shared/src/schemas/photo-date.ts`, each with its message):
  - `validation.datePart`: a month needs a year, a day needs a month;
  - `validation.dateImpossible`: the day exists in that month of that year (no 31 April, 29 February only in a leap year);
  - `validation.dateRange`: a month or a day dates one year: `yearEnd`, when present, equals `year`.
- **The timeline** keeps using `year` and `yearEnd`: `isPhotoNearYear`, the list and the map do not read the new fields.
- **What the visitor reads** (`photoDateText`, in this order): `dateText`, the source's own words, when present (it stays as it was); else the date at its precision through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (`12 July 1936`, `12 iulie 1936`, `July 1936`, `Iulie 1936`: `en-GB` and `ro-RO`, first letter upper case); else the year or years as before (`photo.year`, `photo.years`); else `photo.unknownYear`.
- **The editor**: Year and End year as before; Month appears once there is a year (a list of the month names from `Intl`), Day once there is a month. Clearing the year clears the month and the day, clearing the month clears the day. While the photo has a range the Month field stays hidden, unless it already has a month, which then shows `validation.dateRange` where it can be cleared.

## 2. The source

- **In Firestore nothing new**: `sourceUrl` (https) and `sourceLabel` exist since M2, in the rules, the editor, the upload's remembered choices and the bulk dialog (Author, source and licence).
- **New in the manifest**: `source: {url, label?}`, optional, strict; `url` https only. `assemble.ts` publishes it when the document has a `sourceUrl`. A `sourceLabel` with no address stays in the admin, as before: nothing in the manifest.
- **The viewer**: in the photo sheet, after the rights lines, `Source: <a>` through `externalLink` (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"`, https only, the second line of defence). The link's text is the label, else the address's host name. It is text and an anchor, never HTML from data.
- **The editor**: its own section, Source (address, then the optional name), out of Author and rights. `links` stay as they are; `seed/bucharest/` does not change.

## 3. Compatibility

Additive within manifest v1: an old manifest stays valid and reads as before. v1.0.0 is prepared and not tagged yet, so these fields join the baseline every 1.x engine reads (`docs/ENGINE_API.md` → *Additions before 1.0.0*) and need no `city.engine.minVersion`. Should v1.0.0 be tagged first, this becomes a minor release and the manifest needs `minVersion`.

## 4. Scenarios

Viewer: `S-V07-HAPPY-PRECISE-DATE`, `S-V07-BAD-IMPOSSIBLE-DATE`, `S-V07-HAPPY-SOURCE-LINK`, `S-V07-BAD-SOURCE-NOT-HTTPS`, `S-V07-BAD-NO-SOURCE`; tour state `photo-source`.

Admin: `S-A09-HAPPY-DATE-PRECISION`, `S-A09-BAD-IMPOSSIBLE-DATE`, `S-A09-HAPPY-BULK-SOURCE`, `S-A09-BAD-BULK-SOURCE-NOT-HTTPS`; tour states `photos.editor-date` and `photos.editor-impossible-date`. A source address that is not https in the editor stays `photos.editor-invalid`.
